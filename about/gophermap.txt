<p>I&rsquo;m going to write this page interview style.</p>
<h2 id="who">Who</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-this-international-man-of-mystery">Who is this international man of mystery?</h3>
<p>Nicholas M. Synovic (the last time I&rsquo;ll refer to myself like that) is committed
to creating a better world through education via developing software.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to teach others or educate them on topcis by creating
tools that don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<h3 id="what-do-you-do">What do you do?</h3>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m a Research Assistant at Loyola University Chicago exploring
software supply chain security of machine learning model hubs and solutions for
low powered computer vision.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;m an Intel OneAPI Student Ambassador educating others through
blogs, YouTube videos, and hot takes on social media.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-you-done">What have you done?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on both research and corporate tools that simplify and provide
insights into processes.</p>
<h2 id="where">Where</h2>
<h3 id="where-can-i-find-your-resume">Where can I find your resume?</h3>
<p>Click the
<a href="https://github.com/NicholasSynovic/nsynovic.dev/raw/main/static/resumes/Nicholas_Synovic-Resume.pdf">Resume</a>
link at the top of the page.</p>
<h2 id="when">When</h2>
<h3 id="when-will-you-post-on-social-media-next">When will you post on social media next?</h3>
<p>Great question.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<h3 id="why-are-you-creating-this-site">Why are you creating this site?</h3>
<p>To be the central hub of all the content that I post on social media.</p>
<p>Also because it&rsquo;s cool to website in 2022.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-your-head-in-a-weird-spot-for-your-blog-hero-image">Why is your head in a weird spot for your blog hero image?</h3>
<p>Here is the story.</p>
<p>All of the hero&rsquo;s orginal sizes and aspect ratios where different. This caused
the pages to jump around when navigating. So I cropped everything to the proper
size and aspect ratio to solve the problem.</p>
<p>This resolved the jumpiness, but it introduced that creepy image of my head just
peeking up.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, this site looks better on mobile. And until I get around
to fixing the theme&rsquo;s default styling for desktop regarding heros, I&rsquo;m just
going to leave it as is.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<h3 id="how-did-you-build-this-site">How did you build this site?</h3>
<p>Using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke">Ananke theme</a> because
it&rsquo;s easy peasy.</p>
<p>The domain was bought using <a href="https://domains.google.com">Google Domains</a>.</p>
<p>The site is currently hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> as well.</p>
