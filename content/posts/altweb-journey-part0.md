# My Altweb Journey: Part 0

*What the heck is the altweb?*

This question has lead me down a rabbit hole of network protocols, computer
ethics, philosophies on the internet, and enlightenment. Ok, maybe not
enlightenment, but it definitely has exposed me to a whole side of computing
that I haven't seen before.

But before I go into this potentially long and rambling post, let me say one
thing:

**Don't panic.**

Seriously, what I'm about to describe is not a new version of the internet, your
boss most likely won't bother you with this question ever, and your job is still
safe if you haven't heard of this before. The altweb (as people are now calling
it) is an attempt at a simpler internet at its core.

Now what does that mean?

## The Altweb: A Macro View

The altweb is a collection of *decentralized* networks that are powered by niche
network protocols, focussed around peer to peer sharing. Compare that to today,
where Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AWS dominate the web hosting scene.
These companies power 61% of the modern Internet's web services \[1\]. This
majority stakehold in providing the hosting, compute, and techical services for
powering the Internet has led to these companies centralizing data to their
servers. Because of this centralization, there are serious privacy concerns
\[2\].

To address these security concerns, there has been a growign movement to bring
back the decentralized web where individuals host data instead of these
companies. Protocols such as `Gopher` \[3\], `Gemini` \[4\], `BitTorent` \[5\],
`Hypercore` \[6\], and `IPFS` \[7\] all try to address this challenge. Now,
there is no reason why Google, Microsoft, or Amazon couldn't come out tomorrow
offering to host `gopher` sites for example. After all, these are just web
protocols that anyone with the right software can utilize.

But to make alternatives to these big players and put web hosting back into the
people, Fediverse software \[8\] is being developed to introduce people to
decentralized social media. In this case, the fediverse is predominately a
collection of social media sites that rely on protocols such as `diaspora`
\[9\], `Zot` \[10\], `ActivityPub` \[11\], and `OStatus` \[12\] to power their
backends. For more traditional apps, decentralized apps (dapps) \[13\] powered
by blockchain exist. And for those looking for a decentralized database, `gun`
\[14\] and similar databases now exist as well.

The point in all of this is that each one of these protocols, database schemes,
social media sites, and blockchain technologies exist in their own unique
spheres. As an example, there isn't software out there that combines the power
of the blockchain with `gopher`. But that's ok for now. All of this is still in
its infancy with potential to grow into something larger.
