## A Small Internet

I'm a member of Gen Z and therefore don't remember the Internet ever being "small".
I've only ever experienced it as an incomprehensibly huge monster that by only through the tools of clever search engines it could be navigated.
I've also only ever experienced Web 2.0 [1].
Social media, interconnectivity between sites, cookies, ads, and more have made up my experience on the Internet.

However, what I've learned is that this wasn't always the case.
The internet used to be smaller.
Literally.
It was a collection (and later collections) of documents that were hyperlinked together and distributed over a *decentralized* network.
You had to know exactly where you were going to get there.
Or you relied on tools that did their best at what Google Search does today.
This Internet would become known as Web 1.0 [1].
Document based and read only [2], this internet was focussed more on the distribution of knowledge rather than on social interactions.

This internet was also a wild west of *network protocols*.
Suprisingly (at least to me), `HTTP` [3] wasn't the defacto standard of how the internet used to operate.
Another protocol existed that competed against `HTTP` in the 90s: `gopher` [4].

Yes, that is its actual protocol name.
And like `HTTP`, you access pages via the `gopher://` scheme.
But unlike `HTTP` which supports multimedia content (text, videos, images, etc.), `gopher` only supports text content.
It's no suprise then that as the internet grew, `gopher` couldn't keep up with capabilities of `HTTP` and slowly faded into obscurity.

## The Comeback

And so the Internet grew and grew with `HTTP` to what it is today.
But there were those that remembered the "good old days" of `gopher` and the small Internet.
These people wanted to bring back, in part, that Internet experience with modern technologies or by retrofitting older technologies with newer features.
So as developers do, they started developing server and client software [5] to host `gopher` compatible sites.
And with the proper tools, they got to work hosting `gopher` sites once again.

Huzzah!

But, why haven't we heard about this yet?
And if the small Internet was so great, why haven't we all switched back to it?

In order, we haven't heard about it because it's *small*.
The altweb, as it stands today, is significantly smaller than the modern Internet in every capacity.
And that is by design.
The `gopher` protocol is effectively dead with no new development going into it to improve its capabilities [6].
But people still love it and use it as a hobbiest platform to spread ideas and knowledge to a smaller audience (I'd argue measuring in the tens).

As an example, as I was exploring the "gopher space", I found a number of blogs (phlogs in `gopher` speak) about technology, life, art, politics, philosophy, and more [7].
These documents would never see the light of day on the Internet (unless someone mirrored them), but they were still there!

But there is another problem: `gopher` is dead.
Companies, developers, and end users aren't going to be using a tool because it's neat.
They'll use the tool that will get the job done.
So unless someone starts working on another protocol, this hobbiest communinity won't grow larger or get exposure.

Luckily, people are and are doing a lot more.
