## Summary

Unmanned ground and areal vehiclas (UGVs and UAVs respectfully) are utilized for
precision agriculture. UGVs can carry a larger payload and can run longer, but
suffer from only being operational within 2D space. UAVs have the benefit of
being able to navigate rougher terrains in 3D space, but suffer from limited
flight times and smaller payloads. This article aims to survey the recent
advances in UAV technologies applied to precision farming and to present
opportunities for improvement.

There are many agriculture issues that exist in our world today. Over 700
million people are malnourished, 70% of fresh water is utilized by agriculture
domains, and advancements made on micro scales do not scale to the macro
environment. Having more data from autonomous sensors and vehicles will help
improve the realizations of scientific advancements in scale.

Current UGV technologies suffer from being able to only see points of interest
close to vehicle, they cannont survey large areas quickly, and they are unable
to navigate rough agriculture enviornments (i.e rice fields). UAVs do not suffer
from these drawbacks, however, to work for precision agriculture, UAV
technologies need to work close to crops (under canopy flight), must have
reliable relative coordinate reporting, handle a dynamic environment in 3D space
(i.e wind, rocks, hills), and must be able to map dense environments. There have
been some under canopy tests that have been performed to limited success.
However, these were only applied in small scale environments and haven't been
tested in larger environments.

### UAV Hardware and Autonomy

Current autonomous UAV technologies are availible, but their usage is limited.
They currently are reliant upon GPS, which requires an open canopy, making under
canopy flight currently impossible. Additionally, complex tasks such as
segmentation of fruits or trees is not possible at this time.
