______________________________________________________________________

## First Pass

> Read the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section headings, and
> conclusion

### Problem

> What is the problem addressed in the paper?

The problem is two fold:

1. To build a face detector that is robust to occlusion and "in the wild"
   images.
2. To incorporate facial landmarks via global and local features of the image to
   better isolate not only where the face(s) are within the image, but also the
   eyes, jaw, mouth, etc.

### Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

Because the solution proposed allows for the identification and isolation of
facial features of an input image.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This is a face detection paper as well as CV model architecture paper.

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This paper is related to works involving face and facial landmark detection.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

Their contributions are a methodology for leveraging the relationship between
head pose and face landmarks to find the best shape for initialization and the
usage of global and local CNN features for pose estimation and face alignment in
a cascading manner.

## Second Pass

> A proper read through of the paper is required to answer this

### Background Work

> What has been done prior to this paper?

Work has been done to detect faces and to identify the facial landmarks of a
detected face.

### Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs

> Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
> conclusions are statistically significant?

Nearly all of the figures, charts, and tables are clear. Figure 4 is lacking
description for which set of images correspond to what model.

### Clarity

> Is the paper well written?

The paper is well written.

### Relevant Work

> Mark relevant work for review

The following relevant work can be found in the [Citations](#citations) section
of this article.

### Methodology

> What methodology did the author's use to validate their contributions?

The authors compared their solution (JFA) against other SOTA models including
ERT on pose and facial landmark detection datasets.

### Author Assumptions

> What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?

That global features can capture fine grain detail of an image.

#### Correctness

> Do the assumptions seem valid?

Not really, as global features are intended to look at the feature map as a
whole to identify very large or prominent features (such as an entire face). To
the authors credit, they do discuss this at the end of the paper. But as it
stands, the usage of global features to identify fine grain detail (such as
facial landmarks) is a waste of computational resources that only attempts to
mimic the local feature analysis that their algorithm also performs.

### Future Directions

> My own proposed future directions for the work

I'd like to see if I could optimize their solution by removing the global
feature analysis for facial landmarks component. The idea behind optimizing
their solution is to implement it on a mobile or low powered system.

### Open Questions

> What open questions do I have about the work?

As the solution proposed involves a database lookup to identify areas of
interest for facial landmarks, how robust is that database to rotation, scale,
lighting, and occlusion variance?

### Author Feedback

> What feedback would I give to the authors?

This is an interesting solution to the problem of identifying facial landmarks,
however

## Summary

> A summary of the paper

The paper *Joint Head Pose Estimation and Face Alignment Framework Using Global
and Local CNN Features* by Xiang Xu and A. Kakadiaris \[1\] describes a solution
to not only detect faces, but identify facial landmarks using a cascading CNN
architecture. The reference model for the architecture was able to attain SOTA
results using an off-the-shelf face detector (Dlib) and could accurately
identify facial landmarks. It is able top detect facial landmarks by analyzing
both the global and local features generated from the face detectors feature
maps. A global feature detector is used for pose estimation. This is then passed
into a database of poses used for estimating where facial features are most
likely to be in the input image. A local feature detector than analyzes the
feature map to identify all of the facial landmarks within the image.
