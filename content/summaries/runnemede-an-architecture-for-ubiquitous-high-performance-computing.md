## First Pass

> Discussion about the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section
> headings, and conclusion

The paper *Runnemede: An Architecture for Ubiquitous High-Performance Computing*
by Nicholas P. Carter et al. describes the Runnemede high performance computing
architecture targeting extrene-scale systems. This architecture was developed
for the DARPA's Ubiquitous High-Performance Computing program. The authors
describe multiple facets of the architecture including the networking, hardware
and software design, the energy effeciencies of the architecture. They also
evaluate the performance of the architecture as well. Their mainy contributions
are a theoretical architecture that is well optimized for energy effiecieny on
extra-scale computers.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This is a theoretical paper describing an architecture for HPC systems.

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

Similar works would involve HPC architecture descriptions as well as low powered
computing architectures as well.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

Their contributions are a theoretical design and analysis of a HPC architecture
focused on energy effieciency.

## Second Pass

## Background Work

> What has been done prior to this paper?

Runnemede is a one of four architectures under the DARPA UHPC program.
Additionally, work has been done before to build both low powered cluster
computers, and HPC.

## Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

The justification for this work is that there exists a theory that larger and
larger HPC computers will require more and more power, without fully utilizing
the entire device array. Additionally, this paper proposes an architecture
focussed on an architecture that will

### Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs

> Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
> conclusions are statistically significant?

### Clarity

> Is the paper well written?

### Relevant Work

> Mark relevant work for review

The following relevant work can be found in the [Citations](#citations) section
of this article.
