## First Pass

> Discussion about the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section
> headings, and conclusion

The essay *SVMs - a practical consequence of learning theory* by Bernhard
Scholkopf (as part of the larger *Support vector machine* collection of essays
in the July/ August edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine)
discusses the underlying theory that powers Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithms and argues that these algortihms are useful and performant. His essay
contains sections on *Learning pattern recognition from examples*,
*Hyperplanes*, *Feature spaces and kernels*, *SVMs*, and *Current developments
and open issues* which indicates an essay that will wholistically look at SVMs,
rather than a particualr facet of them.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This paper is best classified as an informative essay on the benefits of SVMs
from a theoretical and practical view.

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This paper is most related to other papers within the magazine's collection, as
well as work that goes into the theory behind SVMs.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

A brief description of the theory that powers SVMs, as well as identifying where
SVMs are practical.

______________________________________________________________________

## Second Pass

## Background Work

> What has been done prior to this paper?

Work has been done to develop and implement the SVM alogirthm.

## Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

Because it provides a concise description of the theory that powers SVMs, and
practical usages of SVMs.

### Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs

> Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
> conclusions are statistically significant?

The paper doesn't provide and graphs or charts. However, the figures and
diagrams that are presented are clearly explained in the descriptions, are well
made, and are easy to comprehand.

### Clarity

> Is the paper well written?

Sort of? The theory components of the essay are written distinctly differently
than the introduction and concluding sections of the paper. This could be due to
the discussion of mathematical prose; but due to this, the essay has two
different voices.

### Relevant Work

> Mark relevant work for review

The following relevant work can be found in the [Citations](#citations) section
of this article.

## Third Pass

> This section can only be complete after a virtual re-implementation of the
> paper

### Future Directions

> My own proposed future directions for the work

I'd like to explore the usage of SVMs for face or object detection and compare
it against the usage of DL techniques on both traditional and low-powered
centric metrics.

## Summary

> A summary of the paper

The essay *SVMs: A Practical Consequence of Learning Theory* by Bernhard
Scholkopf discuss both the mathematical theory and current practice of using
SVMs. SVMs are useful in a research aspect as their functionality can be
mathematically explained. SVMs are a linear classifier that operate in
multi-dimensional space through the usage of a hyper plane. Hyper planes are
choosen by finding support vectors, which are instances of a class that are
closest to one another. The hyper plane then splits these two instances into two
seperable sides. To assist in this calculation, a kernel algorthm is applied to
map one dimensionality space to another for easier computation.

Overall, this paper provides a good understanding of the theory behind SVMs. It
also alludes to additional usages of SVMs and their current problems, but it is
not focused on discussing or resolving them.
