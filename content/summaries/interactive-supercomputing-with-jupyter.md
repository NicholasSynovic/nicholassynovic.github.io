## Summary

The Jupyter project has the potential to allow other scientific domains to
utilize supercomputing resources in an accessible manner. The National Energy
Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) has implemented a Jupyter interface
into their Cori supercomputer. This interface now captures 20% - 25% of user
traffic when working on Cori.

### How It Started And How It's Going

In 2015, NERSC recognized that a growing number of users were using SSH to run
their Jupyter notebooks on the previous generation Edison supercomputer. As
such, NERSC began looking into how to incorporate Jupyter notebooks as a
standard interface into Cori.

#### Phase 1: JupyterHub as Science Gateway

NERSC implemented a separate hardware solution to host JupyterHub. This
JupyterHub instance allowed users to store their notebooks on the NERSC Global
Filesystem (NGF), which allowed teams and individuals to collaborate and run
shared notebooks.

#### Phase 2: Jupyter on a Cori Login Node

Jupyter was than ran on login nodes with outputs piped to computation nodes. The
architecture and hosting of both the Jupyter and JupyterHub instances kept
changing hardware and which confused end users.

#### Phase 3: Jupyter as Interface to an HPC Center

JupyterHub was moved to a Docker container and hosted on Cori. It now acts as
the single point of access for running Jupyter notebooks on Cori, specialty
servers, and staff only test servers.

#### Phase 4: JupyterLab as Innovation Platform

JupyterLab is a product from the Jupyter project aimed at collaboration and
provides many improvements on top of the standard Jupyter project. Such
improvements include better file system navigation and reusability and
reproducibility of notebook experiments. NERSC has created a number of
extensions to support JupyterLab on Cori, including file system navigation
extensions, and `jupyterlab-slurm` for adding `SLURM` job scheduling directly
within JupyterLab.

### Jupyter + HPC = Science!

A number of disciplines now rely on Jupyter to perform calculations on the Cori
supercomputer. These include:

- Geophysical Subsurface Imaging
- Electron Microscope Image Analysis
- Advanced Light Source Tomography
