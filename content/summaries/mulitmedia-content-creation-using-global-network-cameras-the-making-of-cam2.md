## First Pass

> Read the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section headings, and
> conclusion

There exists many cameras in the wild that are openly exposing their feeds to
the interent intended or otherwise. It is therefore possible to create a
database of these open cameras, access their feeds, and create new content
experiences for viewers. Additionally, these feeds provide researchers with an
opportunity to view real world changes longitudinally, thereby enabling studies
that rely on many observations over time. This database and tooling is called
CAM2 (Continuous Analysis of Many CAMeras), and it currently contains 70,000
cameras in the wild.

However, managing and providing a dataset of all this data is difficult.
Furthermore, finding and reporting camera metadata including make and model as
well as geographic location are also non-trivial tasks. Thus CAM2 is working
towards resolving these issues for future revisions.

### Problem

> What is the problem addressed in the paper?

THe problem addressed in the paper is that there exists a spot in content
creation and research to use the camera feeds of openly exposed devices to
create new experiences and insights into the world around us.

Additionally, trying to capture this data requires a significant amount of
engineering and computational resources.

### Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

Because it provides a tool to allow for the creation of new content experiences
and research opportunities using open, internet exposed cameras.

Additionally, it provides a list of problems that reimplementers and extenders
will face when trying to recreate similar tools.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This is a tools paper.

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This paper is related to work involving using open, internet exposed web cameras
for creating new experiences and research opportunities.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

A tool to provide easy access to the internet exposed web cameras.
