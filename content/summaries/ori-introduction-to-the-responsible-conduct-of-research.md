### Foreward

This book is published by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) as supplemental
material to assist in the teaching of the responsible conduct of research. The
ORI oversees and directs the Public Health Service (PHS) research integrety on
behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services as well as the American
public. This book stems from the ethics that were raised in biology related
fields in 1989 and has sinced expanded to become more general and applicable to
other disciplines.

### Preface

As the importance of science and technology increases, so too has the public's
demand for the responsible conduct of research. Simply put, this means that good
citizenship is applied to a researcher's professional life. However, as each
field is different, so too does what "good citizenship" mean within each field.
This book was written to briefly introduce researchers to what is generally
accepted as responsible conduct regardless of their working field.

### Chapter 1: Rules of the Road

There aren't clear rules laid out to for researcher's to easily understand what
is and isn't responsible research conduct. Rather, there are many organizing
bodies, both official and non-official, that govern what is and isn't
responsible. Furthermore, a researcher's personal judgement must also solve this
ethical calculus. In order of importance of whose rules to listen too, it goes:
Professional Codes, Federal, State, institutional policies, and personal
judgement. Not all professions have Professional Codes. Federal regulations have
to first be made available for public comment in the *Federal Register*, and
once accepted, are incorporated into the *Code of Federal Regulations* and must
be followed. Researchers are advised to seek help in understanding Federal
rules.

### Chapter 2: Research Misconduct

Research misconduct policies provide guidance on responsible conduct in these
three areas:

```text
1. Establish definitions for misconduct in research,
2. Outline procedures for reporting and investigating misconduct, and
3. Provide protection for whistleblowers and person accused of misconduct.
```

Federal regulations for research misconduct technically only apply at the
Federal level, but many institutions incorporate and expand it within their own
policies. The Office of Science and Technology Policy's (OSTP), a Federal
agenct, definition of research misconduct is, "fabrication, falsification, or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting
research results". For an action to be considered research misconduct, it must
meet the following criteria:

```text
1. Represent a, "significant departure from accepted practices",
2. Have been, "committed intentionally, or knowingly, or recklessly"; and
3. Be, "proven by a prponderance of evidence".
```

The federal policy puts the responsibility of research misconduct reporting and
investigation on both *researchers* and *their research institutions*. Research
misconduct puts a researcher's career on the line. Additionally, a whistleblower
runs the risk of illegal retaliation. Furthermore, the accused researcher(s)
only face punishment when proven guilty.

The violation of Federal rules, abuse of confidentiality, authorship and
publication violations, failure to report misconduct, obstruction of misconduct
investigations, and other institutional level policies can be classified as
research misconduct. It is assumed that research misconduct is under reported.
Regardless, this misconduct taints the public image of research, wastes donated
or tax-funded dollars, and harms both the professional reputations of
researchers and institutions.
