## First Pass

> Discussion about the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section
> headings, and conclusion

The essay *Using SVMs For Text Categorization* by Susan Dumais et al. (as part
of the larger *Support vector machine* collection of essays in the July/ August
edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) \[1\] provides examples
of when using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is beneficial with respect to text
classification. They discuss text classification, text representation and
feature selection, and an example use case on the Reuters collection. They
support the position that using SVMs for text classification (or really any
algorithm so long as it isn't run by a human) is beneficial for this task.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This essay is more arguementative and position oriented.

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This essay would most likely be classified alongside similar works that
evaluated the usefulness of SVMs with respect to human tasks.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

Their contributions is an analysis of SVMs for text classification.

## Second Pass

### Background Work

> What has been done prior to this paper?

Work has been done to understand what SVMs are, as well as usecases for SVMs.

### Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

Because it provides a case study of using SVMs on the Reuters collection with
respect to text classification.

### Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs

> Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
> conclusions are statistically significant?

All of the graphs and charts are clear to understand and have properly labeled
axis.

### Clarity

> Is the paper well written?

This essay is clearly written.

### Relevant Work

> Mark relevant work for review

The following relevant work can be found in the [Citations](#citations) section
of this article.

- Introduction to Modern Information Retrieval \[2\]
- Fast Training of SVMs Using Sequential Minimal Optimization \[3\]

### Future Directions

> My own proposed future directions for the work

I would like to reimplement their study using the five different learning
algorithms they utilized to validate their results. The algorithms in question
are: Findsim, Naive Bayes, BayesNets, Trees, and LinearSVM.

## Summary

> A summary of the paper

The essay *Using SVMs For Text Categorization* by Susan Dumais et al. (as part
of the larger *Support vector machine* collection of essays in the July/ August
edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) \[1\] presents the usage
of SVMs for text categorization on the Reuters collection in comparison to other
classification algorithms. They found that SVMs perform best on this
classification task.

The greater reason for this essay is to encourage engineers to use learning
algorithms for human intensive tasks - such as text classification.
