The National Academies Advisors to the Nation on Science, Engineering, and Medicine
===================================================================================

The **National Academy of Science** (NAS) (created in 1863) is a
private, non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars
that are required to advise the federal government on scientific and
technical matters.

The **National Academy of Engineers** (NAE) (created in 1964) is a
parallel organization to NAS that also advises the federal government.

The **Institute of Medicine** (created in 1970) is a subsidiary of NAS
aimed at advising the government about public health policy matters.

The **National Research Council** was created in 1916 to broadly advise
on research matters. It is now the primary concern of both NAS and NAE.

Preface
=======

Science is built upon trust. When trust is misplaced and professional
standards are violated, researchers feel attacked and that the base of
their profession has been undermined.

Many new researchers are not learning about how to conduct themselves as
scientists (a broad definition that includes anyone who is involved with
the pursuit of knowledge). This task used to be placed on more senior
researchers. However, as the speed of scientific developments, this task
is often placed on the back burner. Furthermore, exciting opportunities
keep appearing faster than science can keep up, further contributing to
the problem of not educating new researchers on best practices.

Senior researchers have a special responsibility of upholding and
promulgating high standards in science. They should be role models,
teachers, and mentors to junior researchers.

A Note on Using *On Being a Scientist*
======================================

This book explores options for handling situations, not defining what
exactly to do in a particular situation. This book should be read by a
group of researchers that discuss the topics within and figure out how
to apply the lessons to their practice.

The material within this book is not exhaustive, and many texts and
websites now exist to help supplement this material.

The existence of professional standards implies that there is a proper
way to go about a task or field. However, this book doesn't aim to cover
specifics. To address specific concerns, a committee consisting of a
diverse group of individuals from varying experience levels should be
formed to identify and discuss what is the professional standards.
Furthermore, if your professional has an established code of conduct or
professional standards, those should be referred to for specifics.

Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research
===================================================

Researchers pride themselves on observing or explaining phenomenon which
haven't been seen or explained previously. However, researchers are
often under a great deal of personal and professional pressure. Failure
to properly collect, report, or handle data, experiments, or papers can
result in lost time, money, and respect.

Researchers have thus created professional standards over many centuries
for many different fields. It is therefore expected that researchers
will adhere to these standards.

Thus there is an obligation to honor the trust that their colleagues
place in them and vice versa. Irresponsible actions of others could
potentially undermine an entire field.

There is also an obligation for researchers to conduct themselves in a
responsible manner or else face potentially permanent damage to their
reputation.

Additionally, researchers have an obligation to the public. It is their
results that effect public policy which affects everyone. Additionally,
their results may have a butterfly effect that affects international
peoples or policy.

A *scientific standard* is the application of the ethical values of
honesty, fairness, objectivity, openness, trustworthiness, and respect
for others.

*Scientific misconduct* is defined as, “fabrication, falsification or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing researcher, or in
reporting research results,” by the US government.

Those that operate with *scientific misconduct* are said to work with
*questionable research practices*.

The *scientific standard* proliferates throughout the entirety of
science, but *scientific practices* (application of standards) differs
from field to field.

Advising and Mentoring
======================

It is often best to build a diverse community of mentors as not one
person has the same experience, education, or background as another.

Being a mentor is not a one way street where the mentee only benefits.
As a mentor, you experience the benefits of being exposed to new ideas,
building a strong research program and collaboration network, and gain
new friends plus respect from beginning researchers. However, mentors
have influence over the start of a junior researcher's career, and must
therefore be careful not to abuse it. The main role of the mentor is to
help the mentee move along a productive and successful career
trajectory.

Mentees also have responsibilities towards their mentors. They need to
develop clear expectations regarding meeting times and availability with
their mentors, and need to seek out their mentors, rather than expect a
mentor to be provided to them. For more information on this subject,
please read *Adviser, Teacher, Role Model, Friend: On Being a Mentor to
Students in Science and Engineering* by Philip A. Grififths [1].

Treatment of Data
=================

Researchers who maliciously manipulate data to deceive others violate
the basic values and accepted professional standards of science. In
doing so they mislead colleagues, potentially impede progress in their
field, undermine their own authority and trustworthiness, and they
introduce misinformation into both the scientific record and the public
sphere.

To ensure the integrity of science, researchers have developed and
continually improve upon methods such as statistical tests of
significance, double-blind trials, and proper survey phrasing ensured by
the academic's relevant Internal Review Board (IRB). Because it is
paramount that the integrity of the work is valid, papers must include a
description of the methodology used to generate the data. This is
because if the methodology to generate the data is incorrect or not
present, then the integrity of the data and the work can be called into
question. Furthermore, this helps ensure the reproducibility of science.

New researchers are not trained on how to generate, share, store, and
publish data. Additionally, new technologies to store, transmit,
generate, and analyze data are constantly being created. Thus
researchers face a dilemma of how to store data permanently so that it
can be used in future works (either by themselves or with others).
However, when academic works are released the data must be made
available. If a researcher refuses to share the data, then they fail to
maintain the standards of science.

Mistakes and Negligence
=======================

All science is susceptible to error. However, researchers have an
obligation to be as accurate and as careful as possible both for their
profession and the public.

To make progress, researchers must believe the works of other
researchers. It is well known that by, “looking for an answer”, or
believing that there exists an answer prior to running experiments, that
researchers bias themselves to believe that something exists when it
doesn't. However, these inaccuracies and mistakes must be remedied in
the scientific record as soon as they are identified so as to allow the
continue proliferation of science.

Research Misconduct
===================

Scientific misconduct, as defined by the U.S. Office of Science and
Technology Policy, defines it as, “fabrication, falsification, or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in
reporting research results”.

The specific definitions for fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism
(FFP) are listed below (and taken from the text):

.. code:: text

   - Fabrication is "making up data or results."
   - Falsification is "manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or
   changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately
   represented in the research record."
   - Plagiarism is "the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes,
   results, or words without giving appropriate credit."

Furthermore, misconduct actions significantly depart from accepted
practices, that they were intended, or knowingly, or recklessly, and
have to be proven by a preponderance of information. However,
identifying the intent to deceive is difficult to do, as honest mistakes
could also result in the same generated data. Thankfully, differences of
opinion are not scientific misconduct.

To reduce scientific misconduct, co-authors should validate each others
work, as well as have third parties review their results prior to
publication.

Misconduct can set back individuals, institutions, and research fields.
It can also draw the eye of the public and policy makers to make
decisions that are negative for the progression of science.

Responding to Suspected Violations of Professional Standards
============================================================

Science typically self-regulates itself. It is the research community
that sets the standards and practices that researchers should follow.
However, as it is self-regulating, confrontation does occur where
results are questioned.

When raising these questions, retaliation can occur. However, this is
prohibited by the laws do exist to prevent this.

All research institutions that receive federal funding must have methods
to investigate and report misconduct. Anyone who is aware of misconduct
must follow these procedures.

All scientists and research institutions should discourage questionable
research practices (QRPs). Additionally, they need to take
responsibility in determining what QRPs warren reprimands from the
institution. However, not all fields define QRPs the same. The act of
salami-publishing (deliberately dividing research results across
multiple papers) is viewed differently from field to field.

To raise suspicions, ask neutral questions rather than be accusatory.
Another option is to talk to a friend or advisor who can keep the
situation confidential. While this won't necessarily result in changes,
this will at least structure your thinking in what to do next. Another
option is to talk to the research integrity officer who must be
appointed if the institution receives federal funding. However, keep in
mind your own motivations and biases prior to raising questions so as to
be courteous and kind.

Human Participants and Animal Subjects in Research
==================================================

Any research done on humans or animals is subject to federal, state,
local, and institutional regulations.

The U.S. federal regulations on experiments that involve humans is known
as the Common Rule. The Common Rule specifies exactly what falls under
the domain of human participation in experiments. Furthermore, any
research institution receiving federal grants must have an IRB. The job
of the IRB is to ensure that all research involving human participants
follows the Common Rule. Many private institutions also have IRBs.

In some cases where human participation is required, formal training in
bioethics is needed to identify if the experiment is ethical towards the
participants. These issues are often evaluated by the committee's such
as the President's Council on Bioethics in the United States.

Animals also have federal protections with regard to animal
participation in experiments. The U.S. federal Animal Welfare Act seeks,
“to insure that animals intended for use in research facilities … are
provided humane care and treatment.” The U.S. Public Health Service's
*Policy on the Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals* applies to all
research supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH). This
requires institutions, “to establish and maintain proper measures to
ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals involved in research,
research training, and biological testing.” The policy requires
adherence to both the Animal Welfare Act and NIH's continually updated
*Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals*. This requires that
all animal testing follows the three R's:

.. code:: text

   - Reduction in the number of animals used,
   - Refinement of techniques and procedures to reduce pain and distress,
   - Replacement of conscious living higher animals with insentient material

Overseeing the ethical experimentation on animals is an institution's
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).

Laboratory Safety in Research
=============================

Researchers should review safety information and procedures at least
once a year.

A shortlist of topics to review includes:

.. code:: text

   - Appropriate usage of protective equipment and clothing,
   - Safe handling of materials in laboratories,
   - Safe operation of equipment,
   - Safe disposal of materials,
   - Safety management and accountability,
   - Hazard assessment processes,
   - Safe transportation of materials between laboratories,
   - Safe design of facilities,
   - Emergency responses,
   - Safety education of all personnel before entering the laboratory,
   - Applicable government regulations

Sharing of Research Results
===========================

In the 17th century, researchers kept their results secret in order to
protect their results from others claiming them. To solve this, Henry
Oldenburg (the secretary for the Royal Society of London) started to
guarantee that not only researchers could have their results rapidly
published, but that the Royal Society would defend authors integrity. He
furthermore invented the modern review practice of sending out
manuscripts to experts prior to publication for review.

To publish in a peer-reviewed journal is often the most important way to
share information among researchers. This is because the first to
publish often gets the credit. Once results are published, others can
cite the author in their work. Unpublished manuscripts under review are
to be treated as confidential.

Citations need to be scrutinized during the peer-review process in order
to assess their validity and usefulness. Researchers have a duty to
thoroughly search the available literature on a subject and attribute
all relevant authors.

Information can be disseminated through seminars, conferences,
abstracts, and posters as well as peer-reviewed journal papers. Often
considered to be preliminary in nature. Spreading data, results, or
manuscripts that haven't been peer-reviewed online is possible as well.
However, by bypassing traditional quality assurance measures,
researchers take on a risk that their work won't serve science well.

Publishing or announcing results prior to peer-review is dangerous.
Without the peer-review checks, it is possible for misinformation to be
misinterpreted by the public, policy makers, and other researchers as
fact. Additionally, by posting information prior to a journal submission
online, it can be considered to be a “prior publication”, thus making it
unusable for publishing within the journal.

Publication abuses are possible. For example, researchers may publish
the “least publishable unit” of information. This is when the smallest
number of results are collected or written about to be published, rather
than undergoing an intensive research process. This wastes the time and
energy of reviewers and can give the researcher a reputation of
producing shoddy or incomplete work.

Authorship and the Allocation of Credit
=======================================

When a paper is published, all of those that contributed to the paper
are considered authors and should be listed as such. Authorship
conventions and practices differ from field to field, and even lab to
lab. Open and honest conversations about how authorship is handled is
paramount to ensure that everyone knows the rules for the author list
order.

Honorary authors (those that contributed zero to little actual content
to the research) should not be added in the author list. They can be
acknowledged in an “Acknowledgment” section however. Additionally,
ghost-writers should not be used to write a paper.

All authors on a paper must take responsibility for the content of the
paper and must be able to answer questions about the research.

Intellectual Property
=====================

Researchers should be aware of the potential monetary value that their
intellectual property has. Intellectual property is a legal right to
control the application of an idea within a specific context (through a
patent) or control the expression of an idea (through a copyright).

.. code:: text

   - Patent owners can protect [their] intellectual property rights by excluding
   others from making, using, or selling an invention so long as the patent owner
   provides a full description of how the invention is made, is used, and
   functions.

   - Copyrights protect the expression or presentation of ideas, but they do not
   protect the ideas themselves.

Most research institutions have policies that detail how intellectual
policy rights should be handled. Additionally, patent and copyright laws
differ from country to country. Publication of work should not be
delayed because of a potential patent though.

Competing Interests, Commitments, and Values
============================================

Conflict of interest refers to situations where researchers have
personal, intellectual, financial, and professional interests that
conflict with the ongoing research. Conflicts of financial interests
undergo much scrutiny. Should research be done with a known conflict of
financial interest, it severely damages the researcher's credibility and
integrity.

Personal relationships can also conflict with research. Often journals
and funding agencies ask for personal relationships in order to identify
potential conflict of personal interests. Romantic relationships often
count as a personal conflict of interest.

Timely and full disclosure of conflict of interests must be made to
governing bodies of science when requested.

Conflicts of commitment are different than conflict of interests. This
can cause significant strain on a researcher's life and should be
identified early.

The values that a researcher has can cause a conflict of interest as
well. Religious, philosophical, cultural, or political beliefs can all
cause conflicts of interests. Values cannot and should not be separated
from science, but should be acknowledged and understood while conducting
science.

The Researcher in Society
=========================

Researchers have the duty to ensure that not only does their work
further science, but also improves the public's welfare. They are put
into an interesting situation within the public sphere and may have to
wear many hats. However, it is paramount that they remain honest, fair,
collegial, and open in society as these are all core scientific tenants
that researchers should follow.
