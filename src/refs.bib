“Actions of the Chinese government and its institutions that are not in accord with U.S. values of science ethics have raised concerns about foreign influence in the U.S. academic sector.” (Dimotakis and , p. 2) Chinese government and institutions are a major threat to US research security“JASON reviewed classified and open-source evidence” (Dimotakis and , p. 2) There is open-source data on research security breaches“The scale and scope of the problem remain poorly defined” (Dimotakis and , p. 2) The prevalence and impact of research security breaches is undefined“National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189, established in 1985 a clear distinction between fundamental research and classified research.” (Dimotakis and , p. 3) Fundamental research is open to everyone, including adversaries. Classified research has to pass through a control process before release (if released at all)“Universities have mechanisms to handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) under existing categories, such as HIPAA, FERPA, Export control, and Title XIII. CUI protection is difficult, but suited to these tasks, however it is ill-suited to the protection of fundamental research areas.” (Dimotakis and , p. 3) Breaches to research security can involve leaking controlled unclassified information“NSF should adopt, and promulgate to all stakeholders, project assessment tools that facilitate an evaluation of risks to research integrity for research collaborations, and for all non-federal grants and research agreements.” (Dimotakis and , p. 3) Research security and assessment tools should be developed and released to the public“Education and training in scientific ethics at universities and other institutions performing fundamental research should be expanded beyond traditional research integrity issues to include information and examples covering conflicts of interest and commitment.” (Dimotakis and , p. 3) Research integrity risks include conflicts of interest and commitment“the United States is currently being outspent by China in certain areas. Battelle reported in 2012 that “China’s march to prominence in the global R\&D arena remains constant and strong, accounting for \$23 billion on the coming year’s projected growth”22. By 2013, China had surpassed the United States in the number of scientific publications in Physics and Astronomy, considered as fraction of world production23” (Dimotakis and , p. 9) China is both outspending and outproducing American research and development in some areas“objectivity, honesty, openness, accountability, fairness and stewardship” (Dimotakis and , p. 17) Research integrity core values“ASON reviewed evidence from the intelligence community for foreign influence in the U.S. research enterprise that might run counter to U.S. values of science ethics. We have divided the types of influence into four types: reward, deception, coercion and theft. Reward is the offering of material or social goods in exchange for desired behavior; deception is providing incomplete, incorrect information on an application, proposal, or publication for the purpose of hiding or directing attention away from some activity; coercion is the threat of harm or disadvantage for the purpose of enforcing compliance with a demand; and theft is the taking of a physical object or protected idea without permission of the owner.” (Dimotakis and , p. 18) Reward, deception, coercion, and theft are all breaches to research integrity. With respect to theft, that is a breach of research security“Rewards may also be used to encourage activities that compromise research integrity, such as unauthorized sharing of information, theft of material goods (e.g. samples or prototypes), placement of foreign students into a U.S. research group, or other deceptive practices.” (Dimotakis and , p. 18) Specific cases of rewards being used to break research security and integrity“Failure to disclose foreign or domestic affiliations, rewards in the form of cash, lodging, or material goods, or time commitments are examples of deception by omission.” (Dimotakis and , p. 19) Examples of deceptive practices“coercion may take the form of withholding scholarship or fellowship funds if the scholar does not report on their activities, gather requested information, or agree to return to their home country after completing their studies. A U.S.-based researcher may be coerced by the threat of loss of resources, prestige, or privileges in the foreign country. For scholars and U.S.-based researchers who have engaged in deception, exposure of their failure to report may be used to coerce certain behaviors. Loss of privileges or social standing for families of scholars in the United States may also provide a coercive element. Finally, laws requiring citizens of a foreign country to cooperate with the intelligence and security services of that country when asked are a legal form of coercion.” (Dimotakis and , p. 20) Coercion involves threatening someone to do something against their best interests“Samples52, prototypes, software, written documents, and ideas all constitute IP and, in fundamental research, these are the currency of academic achievement and their loss can effect promotions, tenure and grant decisions. In contrast with private sector IP loss, financial considerations are usually secondary” (Dimotakis and , p. 20) Theft has more to do with extracting knowledge over financial gain“Table 1. U.S. researcher enterprise stakeholder rewards, risks and obligations in assessing engagements.” (Dimotakis and , p. 36) Stakeholders of fundamental research are diverse and experience varying levels of risk
