Summary
-------

Computer Vision (CV) research and development is encouraged through
competitions that measure the accuracy of models for cash prizes.
However, as more CV technologies are being pushed towards the edge,
power and computational efficiency of these models become increasingly
more important. Therefore, the *IEEE Low Power Computer Vision
Challenge* (LPCVC) [1], formerly the *Low Power Image Recognition
Challenge*, was created to encourage researchers to develop efficient
low power solutions.

LPCVC
~~~~~

   *Why did you participate in LPCVC?*

Researchers participate to develop and formalize techniques for running
machine learning on the edge. This could be designing new hardware to
accelerate CV models and/or validating optimization and software
techniques developing new CV models. Additionally, this challenge
encourages the discovery of new research topics to pursue.

   *How is LPCVC relevant to activities in the IEEE Computer Society*

The development and support of CV research is crucial the Computer
Society's mission. The technical community, *Technical Community on
Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* [2], exists to promote the
development of research and solutions to problems surrounding and
involving CV. Furthermore, the *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*
(CVPR) conference [3] is currently IEEE's most influential conference as
ranked by *Guide2Research* [4].

LPCVC Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   *Why is research in LPCV important?*

As AI on the edge becomes more ubiquitous and desired by consumers,
academic research my provide industry with potential solutions to
implement on the edge. Furthermore, there exists a hardware challenge
alongside the software challenge of deploying LPCV solutions on edge.
Thus hardware focused research must occur to assist in LPCV
optimizations. Hardware devices such as GPUs, CPUs, and Neural
Processing Units (NPUs) need to be designed and optimized (w.r.t
hardware and software) to support CV applications on the edge.
Therefore, LPCV research involves the union of power efficient designs
and optimizations of both the deployment hardware and solution software.

   *Can you describe one (or several) “grand challenges” using CV; the
   solutions will significantly change the world, but are they far
   beyond today's technologies?*

Better smart systems (e.g.,, smart homes, retail, factory,
transportation, farming, etc.) and prediction of natural disasters and
phenomenon by utilizing many data points can be possible through LPCV.

   *If you have unlimited resources, what would you like to see in the
   area of LPCV?*

Researchers in the space are looking for new datasets, challenges, and
problem specific competitions to advance research in LPCV.
