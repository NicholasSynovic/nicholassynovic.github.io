 Abstract
**********

Software metrics capture information about software development processes and
products. These metrics support decision-making, e.g., in team management or
dependency selection. However, existing metrics tools measure only a snapshot of
a software project. Little attention has been given to enabling engineers to
reason about metric trends over time—longitudinal metrics that give insight
about process, not just product. In this work, we present PRIME
(PRocess MEtrics), a tool to compute and visualize process metrics. The
currently-supported metrics include productivity, issue density, issue spoilage,
and bus factor. We illustrate the value of longitudinal data and conclude with a
research agenda. The tool's demo video can be watched at
`<https://bit.ly/ase2022-prime>`_ . Source code can be found at
`<https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/prime>`_.
