 Abstract
**********

Due to the cost of developing and training deep learning models from scratch,
machine learning engineers have begun to reuse pre-trained models (PTMs) and
fine-tune them for downstream tasks. PTM registries known as "model hubs"
support engineers in distributing and reusing deep learning models. PTM packages
include pre-trained weights, documentation, model architectures, datasets, and
metadata. Mining the information in PTM packages will enable the discovery of
engineering phenomena and tools to support software engineers. However,
accessing this information is difficult — there are many PTM registries, and
both the registries and the individual packages may have rate limiting for
accessing the data.

We present an open-source dataset, PTMTorrent, to facilitate the evaluation and
understanding of PTM packages. This paper describes the creation, structure,
usage, and limitations of the dataset. The dataset includes a snapshot of 5
model hubs and a total of 15,913 PTM packages. These packages are represented in
a uniform data schema for cross-hub mining. We describe prior uses of this data
and suggest research opportunities for mining using our dataset.

The PTMTorrent dataset (v1) is available at:
`<https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=55e17a6e-9d8f-11ed-a2a2-8383522b48d9&origin_path=%2F%7E%2F>`_ .

Our dataset generation tools are available on GitHub:

These metrics support decision-making, e.g., in team management or dependency selection. However, existing metrics tools measure only a snapshot of a software project. Little attention has been given to enabling engineers to reason about metric trends over time—longitudinal metrics that give insight about process, not just product. In this work, we present PRIME (PRocess MEtrics), a tool to compute and visualize process metrics. The currently-supported metrics include productivity, issue density, issue spoilage, and bus factor. We illustrate the value of longitudinal data and conclude with a research agenda. The tool’s demo video can be watched at https://bit.ly/ase2022-prime.
