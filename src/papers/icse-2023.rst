 Abstract
**********

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being adopted as components in software systems.
Creating and specializing DNNs from scratch has grown increasingly difficult as
stateof-the-art architectures grow more complex. Following the path of
traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers have begun to reuse
large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and fine-tune these models for downstream
tasks. Prior works have studied reuse practices for traditional software
packages to guide software engineers towards better package maintenance and
dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of knowledge to guide
behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems.

In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of PTM reuse. We
interviewed 12 practitioners from the most popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face,
to learn the practices and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model the
decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified practices, we
describe useful attributes for model reuse, including provenance,
reproducibility, and portability. Three challenges for PTM reuse are missing
attributes, discrepancies between claimed and actual performance, and model
risks. We substantiate these identified challenges with systematic measurements
in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs future directions on optimizing
deep learning ecosystems by automated measuring useful attributes and potential
attacks, and envision future research on infrastructure and standardization for
model registries.
