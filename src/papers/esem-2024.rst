 Abstract
**********

Background: Software Package Registries (SPRs) are an integral part of the
software supply chain. These collaborative platforms unite contributors, users,
and code for streamlined package management. Prior work has characterized the
SPRs associated with traditional software, such as NPM (JavaScript) and PyPI
(Python). Pre-Trained Model (PTM) Registries are an emerging class of SPR of
increasing importance, because they support the deep learning supply chain.
A growing body of empirical research has examined PTM registries from various
angles, such as vulnerabilities, reuse processes, and evolution. However, no
synthesis provides a systematic understanding of current knowledge. Furthermore,
much of the existing research includes non-quantified qualitative observations.

Aims: First, we aim to provide a systematic knowledge synthesis. Second, we
quantify qualitative claims. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature
review (SLR). We then observed that some of the claims are qualitative, lacking
quantitative evidence. We identify quantifiable metrics associated with those
claims, and measure in order to substantiate these claims.

Results: We identify 12 claims about PTM reuse on the HuggingFace platform, 4 of
which lack quantitative support. We tested 3 of these claims through a
quantitative analysis, and directly compare the fourth with traditional
software. Our most notable findings are: (1) PTMs have a significantly higher
turnover rate than traditional software, indicating more rapid evolution; and
(2) There is a strong correlation between documentation quality and PTM
popularity.

Conclusions: Our findings validate several qualitative research claims with
concrete metrics, confirming prior research. Our measures motivate further
research on the dynamics of PTM reuse.

These metrics support decision-making, e.g., in team management or dependency selection. However, existing metrics tools measure only a snapshot of a software project. Little attention has been given to enabling engineers to reason about metric trends over time—longitudinal metrics that give insight about process, not just product. In this work, we present PRIME (PRocess MEtrics), a tool to compute and visualize process metrics. The currently-supported metrics include productivity, issue density, issue spoilage, and bus factor. We illustrate the value of longitudinal data and conclude with a research agenda. The tool’s demo video can be watched at https://bit.ly/ase2022-prime.
