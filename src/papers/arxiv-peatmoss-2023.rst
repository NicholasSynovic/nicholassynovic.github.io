 Abstract
**********

Developing and training deep learning models is expensive, so software engineers
have begun to reuse pre-trained deep learning models (PTMs) and fine-tune them
for downstream tasks. Despite the wide-spread use of PTMs, we know little about
the corresponding software engineering behaviors and challenges.

To enable the study of software engineering with PTMs, we present the PeaTMOSS
dataset: Pre-Trained Models in Open-Source Software. PeaTMOSS has three parts:
a snapshot of (1) 281,638 PTMs, (2) 27,270 open-source software repositories
that use PTMs, and (3) a mapping between PTMs and the projects that use them. We
challenge PeaTMOSS miners to discover software engineering practices around
PTMs. A demo and link to the full dataset are available at:
`<https://github.com/PurdueDualityLab/PeaTMOSS-Demos>`_.
