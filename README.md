## About

[https://nsynovic.dev](https://nsynovic.dev) is the site where I:

- Showcase my work
- Post blogs
- Attempt to centralize social media posts

## Gopher and Gemini Support

This site supports both the `gopher` and `gemini` protocols.

To build directories specific to each protocol:

1. Clone this repository
2. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch
3. Run `./buildGopherGemini.bash`

Use the newly created `gopher` and `gemini` folders with their respective protocols.
