Problem What is the problem addressed in the paper?
This paper aims to understand the issue of developers and managers having differing views of productivity, and when to trade the quality of the product for more productivity. Additionally, this calls into question what is quality, as well as how does one measure both of these attributes.
Motivation Why should we care about this paper?
We should care about this paper as it provides a case study conducted with Microsoft developers and managers about how they measure and value productivity. Thereby allowing establishing what a sample of developers define productivity as, and what a sample of managers define it as well. Additionally, the authors propose utilize their existing framework SPACE to codify developer and manager responses. They also propose a new framework, TRUCE, designed to help developers and managers make decisions about software quality vs productivity tradeoffs. These frameworks are releated but provide different lenses into software development.
Category What type of paper is this work?
This paper is a survey paper of practicioners in industry.
Context What other types of papers is the work related to?
This paper is closely related to industry metric usage survey papers, productity and quality papers, and - more broadly - papers that disucss the usage of and of software metrics in teams.
Contributions What are the author&rsquo;s main contributions?
Thier contributions is a survey of what developers and managers at Microsoft consider to be productivity and quality, as well as the TRUCE framework for identifying when quality vs productivity should be tradedoff.
Second Pass A proper read through of the paper is required to answer this
Background Work What has been done prior to this paper?
Work has been done into understanding what software quality is, how to measure productivity, and what is productivity. Also, the authors have previously described a framework called SPACE (Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Collaboration, and Efficiency) which was used to codify the responses from the survey participants.
Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
All of the figures are labeled properly, easy to understand, and have clear captions.
Clarity Is the paper well written?
The paper is well written. However, I&rsquo;m not a fan with how the abstract was structured. I found the topic-description approach didn&rsquo;t engage me as a reader. But that is more of a personal opinion than an objective fact.

The SPACE of Developer Productivity: There’s More to It than You Think Motivation and satisfaction of software engineers Why We Should Not Measure Productivity Appendix to How Developers and Managers Define and Trade Off Productivity and Quality Towards a Theory of Software Developer Job Satisfaction and Perceived Productivity Methodology What methodology did the author&rsquo;s use to validate their contributions?
The authors conducted a survey of Microsoft developers and managers on how they define productivity and quality, as well as the trade offs between productivity and quality. 167 responses were collected, with 131 responses being from developers and 34 from managers. Responses were codified using the SPACE methodology proposed by the authors in a previous work.
Comparisons were made between how:
Developers define productivity Managers define team productivity Developers define quality Managers define team quality How developers think managers define team productivity How managers think developers define productivity Do developers and managers trade quality for productivity? Author Assumptions What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?
They propose the TRUCE framework for software quality (Timeliness, Robustness, User Needs, Collaboration Needs, and Evolvable) based on this study alone.
Correctness Do the assumptions seem valid?
I don&rsquo;t think that TRUCE can stand on its own just on this work. Additional surveys and work need to be done to validate the usefulenss and how applicable this framework is outside of the subset of developers and managers at Microsoft that responded to the survey. The authors do address this in their paper.
Future Directions My own proposed future directions for the work
I&rsquo;d love to perform a literary review of related works and surveys to identify if the TRUCE framework is applicable. Additionally, I&rsquo;d like to perform a follow up study of answering and analyzing the question as to what developers think managers consider to be quality work and vice versa.
Open Questions What open questions do I have about the work?
What prevented the authors from asking about what developers and managers think the other considers quality work?
Author Feedback What feedback would I give to the authors?
I appreciate the clear figures, charts, and tables. I don&rsquo;t like the style of the abstract as it doesn&rsquo;t engage me as a reader. But the finding boxes that summarize the survey results per subsection were a nice touch and are appreciated.
Summary A summary of the paper
The paper How Developers and Managers Define and Trade Productivity for Quality by Margaret-Anne Storey et al. [1] presents the results of a survey conducted on 131 Microsoft developers and 34 managers about what they consider to be productive work, quality work, what the other cohort defines each topic, and if they have ever made explicit trade offs between productivity and quality. The authors took the responses and codified them using the SPACE framework that they proposed in an earlier paper [2].
They found that developers tend to define productive work as activities (number of tasks completed or iterations; 50%), efficiency and flow (entering a flow state; 38%), and productivity (delivering on projects; 35%). Managers tend to define productive work across the team in productivity (67%), efficiency and flow (45%), and collaboration (working with others to brainstorm ideas/ providing feedback; 33%).
However, developers think managers define team productivity in activity (53%), productivity (37%), and collaboration (19%). Whereas managers think developers define productivity in activity (52%), efficiency and flow (42%), and productivity (24%). Here, both managers and developers think the other defines productivity than what is actually true.
The take away with productivity, is that all participants defined productivity under the SPACE framework.
Quality was defined under the proposed TRUCE (Timeliness, Robustness, User Needs, Collaboration, Evolution) framework. Developers and managers both define quality similarly as robustness (71%, 88%), evolution (44%, 33%), and user need (38%, 39%). Managers rank user need higher than evolution, where as developers disagree with them.
Summarization Technique This paper was summarized using a modified technique proposed by S. Keshav in his work How to Read a Paper [0].
