Problem What is the problem addressed in the paper?
The problem addressed in this paper is to develop a fully convolutional semantic segmentation model capable of learning from a small number of training examples in a short period of time.
Motivation Why should we care about this paper?
We should care about this paper because it builds off of the ideas of a fully convolutional neural network for the purpose of semantic segmentation, but introduces training techniques to reduce the number of training examples needed as well as a novel architecture to support training on few examples.
Category What type of paper is this work?
This is a semantic segmentation computer vision work.
Context What other types of papers is the work related to?
This work is most closely related to papers that discuss the fully convolutional solutions to the semantic segmentation task.
Contributions What are the author&rsquo;s main contributions?
Their main contributions are a novel architecture designed built around semantic segmentation and a fully convolutional architecture. Additionally, they discuss how they utilized data augmentation and elastic deformation to increase the amount of training data.
Second Pass A proper read through of the paper is required to answer this
Background Work What has been done prior to this paper?
Work has been done to develop fully convolutional neural networks, to develop fully convolutional semantic segmentation models, and the development of data augmentation techniques.
Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
The figures are clear and easy to read.
Clarity Is the paper well written?
This is a well written paper that is easy to follow.
Relevant Work Mark relevant work for review
The following relevant work can be found in the Citations section of this article.
Methodology What methodology did the author&rsquo;s use to validate their contributions?
The author&rsquo;s compare their semantic segmentation model against other models on the ISBI EM Challenge.
Author Assumptions What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?
The author assumes that data augmentation is enough to make a model robust against rotation, shift, deformations, and gray value variations.
Correctness Do the assumptions seem valid?
I disagree with their assumptions as, while yes, data augmentation is necessary to make a model or system robust against the different variance mentioned, also exposing the model to more data should further increase the robustness of it.
Future Directions My own proposed future directions for the work
I&rsquo;d like to try and run the proposed model architecture on semantic segmentation datasets that aren&rsquo;t ones for cellular imagery.
Open Questions What open questions do I have about the work?
Just how much data was the model trained on?
Author Feedback What feedback would I give to the authors?
This is a fine paper. It is fairly short and is lacking technical details that would be appreciated. For example, how much data was augmented? As well as the metrics values proposed here.
Summary A summary of the paper
The paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation by Olaf Ronneberger et al. [1] which describes a model architecture and training details for semantic segmentation. The model architecture is known as a U-Net. A U-Net is composed of two halves. The first half is a standard convolutional network that encodes the feature map; the second half up-samples and decodes the first and is then a convolutional neural network. The training methodology proposed involves data augmentation to train this network on a small dataset. The authors were able to achieve SOTA semantic segmentation performance on the dataset the they were using.
Summarization Technique This paper was summarized using a modified technique proposed by S. Keshav in his work How to Read a Paper [0].
