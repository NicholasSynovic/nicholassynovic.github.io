Citations Summary The Jupyter project has the potential to allow other scientific domains to utilize supercomputing resources in an accessible manner. The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) has implemented a Jupyter interface into their Cori supercomputer. This interface now captures 20% - 25% of user traffic when working on Cori.
How It Started And How It&rsquo;s Going In 2015, NERSC recognized that a growing number of users were using SSH to run their Jupyter notebooks on the previous generation Edison supercomputer. As such, NERSC began looking into how to incorporate Jupyter notebooks as a standard interface into Cori.
Phase 1: JupyterHub as Science Gateway NERSC implemented a separate hardware solution to host JupyterHub. This JupyterHub instance allowed users to store their notebooks on the NERSC Global Filesystem (NGF), which allowed teams and individuals to collaborate and run shared notebooks.
Phase 2: Jupyter on a Cori Login Node Jupyter was than ran on login nodes with outputs piped to computation nodes. The architecture and hosting of both the Jupyter and JupyterHub instances kept changing hardware and which confused end users.
Phase 3: Jupyter as Interface to an HPC Center JupyterHub was moved to a Docker container and hosted on Cori. It now acts as the single point of access for running Jupyter notebooks on Cori, specialty servers, and staff only test servers.
Phase 4: JupyterLab as Innovation Platform JupyterLab is a product from the Jupyter project aimed at collaboration and provides many improvements on top of the standard Jupyter project. Such improvements include better file system navigation and reusability and reproducibility of notebook experiments. NERSC has created a number of extensions to support JupyterLab on Cori, including file system navigation extensions, and jupyterlab-slurm for adding SLURM job scheduling directly within JupyterLab.
Jupyter + HPC = Science! A number of disciplines now rely on Jupyter to perform calculations on the Cori supercomputer. These include:
