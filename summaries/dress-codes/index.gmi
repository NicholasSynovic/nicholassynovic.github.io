## Seeing Yoyself On Screen: Camille Friend

Camille Friend is a Hollywood hair stylist most famous for her work on the movie *Black Panther*.

She was, "born a hair stylist".
Her uncle owned a black hair salon which she worked at and got her spot.

As the hair stylist for *Black Panther*, she changed the game by asking all of the actors to come in with their natural hair.
This was different as black actors are asked to straighten and pre-style their hair prior to arriving on set.
