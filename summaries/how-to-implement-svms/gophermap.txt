The essay How to implement SVMs by John Platt (as part of the larger Support vector machine collection of essays in the July/ August edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] discusses how to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM). This essay goes into great detail on implementation strategies for handling larger datasets, as well as methods for training SVMs. Topics include understanding the Quadratic Problem (what SVMs aim to solve), sequential minimal optimization (reaching a global minimal value), and where to find SVM implementations.
Category What type of paper is this work?
This essay seems to be a tutorial/ workshop paper about SVMs.
Context What other types of papers is the work related to?
I would expect papers that are about implementing SVMs from scratch would be related to this essay.
Contributions What are the author&rsquo;s main contributions?
Their main contributions are an understanding of how SVMs work as well as how to implement them efficently.
Second Pass Background Work What has been done prior to this paper?
Work has already been done on experimenting optimal SVM algorithms and minimization functions.
Motivation Why should we care about this paper?
We should care about this paper as it provides an understanding of what a SVM is and how they function.
Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
The figure and charts have proper labels and captions that explain what they are representing.
Clarity Is the paper well written?
For the most part, yes. However, the essay expects the reader to be knowledgable about SVMs prior to reading the essay. This is shown mostly through the usage of mathematical notation specific to the problem domain, and linking to other work to explain it. While this is a short essay for a magazine, a brief sentence or two about the notation would have been appreciated.

Author Assumptions What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?
The author assumes that the reader, should they implement their own SVM algorithm, will be using a commericial numerical analysis package.
Correctness Do the assumptions seem valid?
Without understanding the nature of the numerical analysis packages of 1998, I would assume that this assumption is correct. I base this on that the author mentions that free numerical analysis packages (not if they were open sourced or not) run slower than commercial packages and may have errors due to precision mistakes.
Future Directions My own proposed future directions for the work
I&rsquo;m not interested in creating my own SVM algorithm. However, having a better understanding of how SVMs work as well as the different minimization functions that they implement, would be nice to know.
Summary A summary of the paper
The essay How to implement SVMs by John Platt (as part of the larger Support vector machine collection of essays in the July/ August edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] discusses how to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The author goes into detail about what an SVM is trying to accomplish (minimize a quadratic problem on a high dimensional matrix), what techniques exist to solve this problem, as well as availible programs to allow for researchers to utilize SVMs in their work.
Overall, the essay does a good job of explaining the problem space as well as implementation details, however, the essay is very much a product of its time. There is less of a need to develop new SVM algorithms as there are many that are provided off of the shelf in free and open source numerical analysis packages [3] [4]. Additionally, the suggestion that readers should purchase a numerical analysis package to create thier own SVM is dated in my opinion, as again, there are many free options availible [5].
