First Pass

   Discussion about the title, abstract, introduction, section and
   sub-section headings, and conclusion

The essay *Using SVMs For Text Categorization* by Susan Dumais et
al. (as part of the larger *Support vector machine* collection of essays
in the July/ August edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems
magazine) [1] provides examples of when using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) is beneficial with respect to text classification. They discuss
text classification, text representation and feature selection, and an
example use case on the Reuters collection. They support the position
that using SVMs for text classification (or really any algorithm so long
as it isn't run by a human) is beneficial for this task.

Category
~~~~~~~~

   What type of paper is this work?

This essay is more argumentative and position oriented.

Context
~~~~~~~

   What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This essay would most likely be classified alongside similar works that
evaluated the usefulness of SVMs with respect to human tasks.

Contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   What are the author's main contributions?

Their contributions is an analysis of SVMs for text classification.

Second Pass
-----------

Background Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   What has been done prior to this paper?

Work has been done to understand what SVMs are, as well as use cases for
SVMs.

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

   Why should we care about this paper?

Because it provides a case study of using SVMs on the Reuters collection
with respect to text classification.

Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so
   that conclusions are statistically significant?

All of the graphs and charts are clear to understand and have properly
labeled axis.

Clarity
~~~~~~~

   Is the paper well written?

This essay is clearly written.

Relevant Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Mark relevant work for review

- Fast Training of SVMs Using Sequential Minimal Optimization [3]

Future Directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   My own proposed future directions for the work

I would like to implement their study using the five different learning
algorithms they utilized to validate their results. The algorithms in
question are: Findsim, Naive Bayes, BayesNets, Trees, and LinearSVM.

Summary

   A summary of the paper

The essay *Using SVMs For Text Categorization* by Susan Dumais et
al. (as part of the larger *Support vector machine* collection of essays
in the July/ August edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems
magazine) [1] presents the usage of SVMs for text categorization on the
Reuters collection in comparison to other classification algorithms.
They found that SVMs perform best on this classification task.

The greater reason for this essay is to encourage engineers to use
learning algorithms for human intensive tasks - such as text
classification.
