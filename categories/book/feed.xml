&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No book is an island&amp;rdquo;. In other words, it takes many authors and contributors
who, while not the primary author(s), deserve to be recognized for their
contributions. However, all errors in the book are the primary author&amp;rsquo;s
responsibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The need for a diverse workforce has only grown as we as a species have become
increasingly more interconnected. However, diversity efforts often look like
Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark: two of each kind of diversity. This only makes the problem look like
its solved and yet it hasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Diversity often gets eye rolled as an annoyance. It also gets a bad rep as
people think that diversity efforts favor some over others. However, diversity
itself isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem. It is the unconscious biases that we bring into the
workplace that are the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Changes with respect to diversity start from the top of the organization and
move downward. Leaders can&amp;rsquo;t expect diversity changes without recognizing and
addressing their own unconscious biases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Corporate power composition is changing. There are slowly more non-white male
leaders entering and taking the lead at companies internationally. And for
companies working within the global market, the workplace is now a bag of many
individuals from different backgrounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>True diversity requires changes to the unconscious bias. &lt;em>Dominant groups&lt;/em> with
respect to diversity refer to those who have traditionally held power.
&lt;em>Non-dominant groups&lt;/em> are those that have been typically under represented, feel
less entitled to their position, and need to navigate the workplace differently
than those in dominant groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Diversity is more than skin color. It is a reflection of someone&amp;rsquo;s upbringing.
Two white men with the same views about everything but favor rival sports teams
are a diverse group. This seemingly insignificant difference can result in an
unconscious bias about the other between the two men. Because of issues like
these, where skin color is not the issue but cultural, age, gender, and
religious biases are, we must move beyond the concept of the Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark of
diversity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people within the dominant group believe that the workplace is a
meritocracy. Whereas the non-dominant group members differ and believe that
because of their differences between them and the dominant group that they
didn&amp;rsquo;t receive the same merits as often. They rather felt like poster children
for diversity issues. As white men are typically the dominant group, they are
often surprised to hear this. That is why moving beyond diversity 1.0 (Noah&amp;rsquo;s
Ark) to diversity 2.0 is so important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike men, women often find that their lives often don&amp;rsquo;t have much control and
that, &amp;ldquo;things happen&amp;rdquo;. Mary Catherine Bateson is anthropologist and resident of
the Institute for Intercultural Studies [3] whose book, &lt;em>Composing a Life&lt;/em>
[1] talks about this topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conscious leadership does matter. Psychologist and Harvard professor Howard
Gardner&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em>Leading Minds&lt;/em> [2] describes great leaders of having the
following four traits:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. A “True North” that serves as an internal compass of values
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. The willingness to challenge authority
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. The practical skills to communicate to others
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>4. The ability to travel outside their own worldview
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This framework, as well as the additional qualities coupled from the Center for
American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University [4] kick started the
research for this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Women politicians operate differently than their male counterparts with respect
to interacting with constituents, speaking in committee meetings, and bill
proposals. If this is the case, what would a woman American president look like?
With this in mind, interviews with each of the 15 (fifteen) women world leaders
of the world were scheduled and whose discussions would be used to help compile
this book. Through these meetings, the Liswood found out that women&amp;rsquo;s voice
often rise at the end of sentences. Because of this small pattern change that
men didn&amp;rsquo;t do, women are often treated differently then men. Margaret Thatcher
actually went to a speech therapist to drop this speech pattern. However in
doing so she lost a bit of her diverse self by conforming to what other&amp;rsquo;s
expected out of her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Diversity is not the problem. Dominant and non-dominant groups are not at fault
for failing to make diversity work. Rather, it is the unconscious handling of
diversity that is at fault and causes many of the issues that we experience with
respect to diversity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chapter-1-beware-of-noahs-ark">Chapter 1: Beware of Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Too many leaders think that if you take two of each kind of diversity, that you
have achieved diversity. This incentives creating a numbers game surrounding
diversity, rather than incorporating diverse workers and leaders in the
leadership, management, and execution stages of corporations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark will result in clashes between diverse groups because of
unconscious and conscious biases, and results in the problems that diversity
gets a bad reputation for. Problems will continue to arise in the workplace
until we understand our own biases about others. Only then can we reap the
benefits of diversity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The benefits of diversity include increased creativity, better ideas, and
multiple perspectives. This was explained by journalist James Surowiecki in his
book &lt;em>The Wisdom of Crowds&lt;/em> [5]. Introducing a heterogeneous member to a
homogeneous group will result in the group not bonding at first, however, the
cognitive diversity and creative output will be much greater than the original
homogeneous group&amp;rsquo;s once the full potential has been reached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Washington Post reported in it&amp;rsquo;s survey article, &lt;em>Most Diversity Training
Ineffective, Study Finds&lt;/em> [6] that compulsory diversity training resulted in
diverse people leaving companies or leadership positions. Voluntary diversity
training that furthered company goals resulted in better diversity practices.
Changes to improve better diversity practices need to involve addressing the
biases of others. These changes often start with the unthinkable, then the
impossible, and eventually become inevitable. This is difficult though because
diversity requires change. To kick off better diversity, it only takes a small
few to start the inevitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Diversity 2.0 can only start once Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark has been built. But what
conflicting views can exist within the Ark? Views can include the opinions of
the national origins of coworkers, age, culture, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic or class, marital status, family, language,
positions, titles, seniority, work location within an organization, hobbies,
and/or physical appearance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>National origins refer to what one nationality thinks of another. The
stereotypes and ideas about who one based on where they are from by coworkers of
different nationalities can cause rifts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Age refers to the expectations that we place on people to accomplish a task
based on the general skill level, trend, or ideas that a particular age group is
stereotyped as having.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Culture refers to the cultural differences between coworkers. This could include
formalities, dining, rituals, habits, and other differences based on where
someone grew up. These can be best detected by thoughts along the line of,
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not what we do here&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Religion is often polarizing. However, it also implicitly and explicitly affects
how someone&amp;rsquo;s culture is defined. Furthermore, holidays are another factor that
needs to be considered when working towards a truly diverse work place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Socioeconomic or class refer to the financial status of individuals. Rich and
poor people have different problems, goals, and management strategies with
respect to their finances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marital status is often hand in hand with gender politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Family status is often difficult to handle. For managers, questions about when
the individual is leaving, who to replace them with, and what the environment
will be like while they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy are both
reasonable, but bordering judgmental, questions. They also can be used against
an employee, even if not meant to intentionally to cause harm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Languages and language dialects can be used to classify individuals.
Additionally, as English is the predominant language in the workplace, the more
English that a non-English speaker knows, the &amp;ldquo;smarter&amp;rdquo; they appear to some.
This is because they are finally able to communicate their already smart ideas
in a different language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Access to managers and leaders often disparages those who don&amp;rsquo;t have access to
those individuals. Those that do often receive the promotion, insider
information, or other merit. This is because the manager or leader has gotten a
chance to become familiar and trust the individual, and thus feels comfortable
handing this position to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other types of diversity in the Ark too that are not discussed in this
book. Regardless, efforts must be made to identify and address the biases with
respect to these diverse groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes we go looking for a trait in someone. For example, building a leader
from nothing simply because they meet physical definition of a leader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Confirmation bias is best characterized as, &amp;ldquo;I know what I know because I know
it&amp;rdquo;. But organizations will not benefit from hiring for diversity as long as
they continue to hire what they know is best.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="objections-to-diversity">Objections to Diversity&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The following objections are common to hear from the dominant group when
presented with diversity related decisions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reverse discrimination&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defies the meritocracy of the organization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coddling the diverse individuals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lack of evidence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rocking the boat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s all about the law&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don&amp;rsquo;t blame me for the success that I&amp;rsquo;ve had&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="chapter-2-the-elephant-and-the-mouse">Chapter 2: The Elephant and the Mouse&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In power structures their are elephants and mice. Elephants don&amp;rsquo;t need to know
much about mice when they walk into the room. Mice need to know everything about
elephants in order to make sure they aren&amp;rsquo;t crushed. Dominant groups are
elephants; non-dominant groups are mice and build a skill set around being a
successful mouse. Because of this, elephants think that the world operates the
same way for everyone as it does for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However leaders need both the skills that elephants and mice have. Leaders need
to learn just as much about their constituents and team as the team learns about
them. Emotional intelligence is key for leaders to learn. Being able to perceive
how they as well as others are feeling when they walk into the room is a
characteristic mouse technique but is critical for leadership. Additionally,
agile and adaptive skills are extremely useful. With respect to diversity, they
need to understand that what they experience might not reflect what others are
experiencing around them. However, it is still crucial for leaders to be
confident, responsible, and able to move forward with tough decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If an elephant abuses their position of power, the mice might revolt. Small
players can easily take down a larger player by biding their time and using
their emotional intelligence to know when to strike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there is an asymmetrical power dynamic, the power goes to those who are more
independent. It is possible to look at the different diversity types from
&lt;a href="#chapter-1-beware-of-noahs-ark">Chapter 1&lt;/a> and identify different elephant and
mouse positions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="combining-forces">Combining Forces&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Being a leader requires flexibility and the desire to learn new qualities to
better lead. For example, if a leader can&amp;rsquo;t communicate, they can&amp;rsquo;t lead. It is
important to relate to people, and to have others perceive leaders as one of
their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="point-of-view">Point of View&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Someone&amp;rsquo;s point of view of their working style can be seen as the correct way
and other&amp;rsquo;s as wrong because they don&amp;rsquo;t do this. Being able to step outside of
yourself and identify that your point of view may not be the correct way or that
others aren&amp;rsquo;t experiencing the world as you do is crucial for leadership. These
biases towards a particular viewpoint need to be understood and addressed to
achieve diversity 2.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chapter-3-tell-your-grandma-to-go-home">Chapter 3: Tell Your Grandma to Go Home&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Grandma refers to societies implicit and explicit teachings that leaders carry
with them. Experiences, the media, myths and legends, as well as our belief
system make up Grandma. Additionally, the lessons that we learned from family or
mentors also makes up Grandma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grandma is different from nation to nation, or more broadly, culture to culture.
In America the saying, &amp;ldquo;The squeaky wheel gets the grease,&amp;rdquo; means that speaking
up and being assertive is the best. However in Japan the equally popular saying,
&amp;ldquo;The nail that sticks out gets hit on the head,&amp;rdquo; means to be punished if
assertive. Likewise, in China they have the saying, &amp;ldquo;The loudest duck gets
shot&amp;rdquo;. Furthermore, women in America are taught that, &amp;ldquo;If you can’t say anything
nice, don’t say anything at all,&amp;rdquo; which means to not be assertive if they don&amp;rsquo;t
have an agreeing opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if a Wheel, Nail, Duck, and Nice were in a strategy meeting with their boss,
the Wheel would dominate the conversation and potential receive a merit because
of their outspoken-ess whereas everyone else could be subtly or overtly punished
for their lack of contributions. However, that was only because the Nail, Duck,
and Nice learned from their Grandma, &amp;ldquo;proper etiquette,&amp;rdquo; which was wrong in this
case. This is an example of how diversity failed as the cognitive diversity that
was initially desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="necessary-but-not-sufficient">Necessary but not Sufficient&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many corporations make strong business cases for diversity, such as the war for
talent, higher profitability, the global nature of the firm, and/or the legal
scrutiny and laws for diversity in many countries. They have additionally put
the building blocks in place for diversity, such as diversity training,
senior-level rhetoric, and diversity related communities. While these are
foundational, they are not enough for true diversity as we still bring Grandma,
and thus all of our conscious and unconscious biases to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="preconceived-notions-have-roots">Preconceived Notions Have Roots&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Harvard social psychologist Mahzarin Banaji has been studying the irreplaceable
notions that are ingrained in the human brain. She has found that there exists
certain unconscious reactions that your brain gives off to different faces.
Additionally, she found that this preference starts around the age of 6 (six),
when we start to hang out with others who are more like us. As we age, different
faces become naturally associated with positive and negative emotions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Unconscious thinking comes from the following sources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our parents, as they lay out expectations and guide them to the best of their
knowledge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our experiences, as they tell us not only how the world works but also how it
should work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our peers, as they show us what to do to fit in&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Myths, fairy tales, fables, and the media as they carry long standing
archetypes throughout the generations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="chapter-4-whats-easy-for-you-is-hard-for-me-and-how-to-navigate-the-differences">Chapter 4: What&amp;rsquo;s Easy for You Is Hard for Me and How to Navigate the Differences&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most manager&amp;rsquo;s would say that an underappreciated, hardworking employee gets
left behind, that they should speak up. However, what if that employee is a
diverse individual? Thus the better solution would be for the manager to become
more perceptive to the employee and the employee overcoming some of the cultural
norms. Thus leaders need to have a greater degree of awareness and set of tools
than merely suggesting what the employee should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="getting-noticed-in-noahs-ark">Getting Noticed in Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>To be successful at work, employees must get their work noticed. However, as
diverse individuals, they might believe that the opposite (being unseen, working
hard, and not making a fuss) will lead to success. This could&amp;rsquo;ve been learned
through Grandma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus the problem with corporate diversity is that while everyone wants
diversity, only the Wheels will be heard and the Nails, Ducks, and Nices will be
forgotten or suffer. To address, this managers should ask for others ideas or
inputs. Additionally, informing employees that ideas are looking to be shared at
the meeting is another way of preparing employees for questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Management is responsible for getting the benefits of diversity out of their
team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="getting-out-of-your-own-comfort-zone">Getting Out of Your Own Comfort Zone&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Managers can&amp;rsquo;t take everything on themselves. To some degree, employees are
expected to take it into their own hands to adjust to the company&amp;rsquo;s style, but
not in a compliance-like manner. In other words, to adjust to the company&amp;rsquo;s
style while maintaining their diversity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Power issues arise regardless of gender. Men will typically dominate a mixed
gender group, whereas women will be more quiet. However, in an all women group
some women will be more assertive than others. This is not a gender issue then,
it is a power issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are clear power dynamics in for-profit companies. Larger offices at the
top, cubicles at the bottom; fewer higher paying jobs at the top, more lower
paying jobs at the bottom. The issue is not that there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough low-tier
employees talking to their managers, its that in a diverse company not everyone
is &lt;em>comfortable&lt;/em> doing so. Thus when a merit comes about, the manager gives it
to those that have kept them informed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gender roles are very devise in the office. More man assume that they can run
for office than women. And when women do run for office, it is often for a
smaller role that they feel ready for. Whereas men will run for larger roles
that they may not be immediately qualified for. Additionally, women estimate
fair pair 4% less than men early in their careers, and 23% less then men at the
peak of their careers. Furthermore, in a study involving counting dots until
participants felt like they could stop, women counted 22% longer than men and
32% more dots. Women also get labeled as bitchy and pushy when being assertive
and that Grandma taught them to not be assertive. The takeaway here is that
gender plays into the pursuit of merits. Overtime in a diverse culture, the
lifetime earnings of diverse individuals will be less then men should they not
follow the same path as men. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to conform to how men operate,
but that being assertive and getting out of your comfort zone does pay off,
however it can be an uphill battle if your company doesn&amp;rsquo;t support diverse
initiatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="critical-feedback">Critical Feedback&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Managers need to give employees critical feedback, stretch assignments, and
mentoring in order for the employees to prosper. Typically though, only those in
the dominant group are given these benefits. In a study of employee performance
between managers and the employees themselves, there was a large disparity of
what managers thought the skill level of employees from the non-dominant group
vs the employees themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, managers dealing with diverse employees worry about their critical
feedback not being received positively. Common concerns involve being called
racist, sexist, or subject to litigation. So managers scrape by by telling their
employees that they are fine. Fine could very well mean, &amp;ldquo;Feelings Inside Not
Expressed&amp;rdquo; though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Positive allusion is a sociological trait that men have developed where they
hear the positives about themselves first. Women have developed negative
allusion which is the converse of the above statement. This causes men to give
other men direct, critical feedback, and women to approach the same subject in
an indirect relational fashion. The best way to clearly give feedback is to ask,
&amp;ldquo;What did you hear me say?&amp;rdquo; as this then allows the two parties to make sure
that they are on the same page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Men typically are allowed to get angry in the workplace and express frustration.
Whereas women are labeled as &amp;ldquo;bitchy&amp;rdquo; for the same behavior. However, if they
don&amp;rsquo;t, their frustrations are never heard. Thus this double bind position that
women are in (damned if they do, damned if they don&amp;rsquo;t) prevents women and other
non-dominant groups from prospering.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="who-apologizes-and-who-interrupts">Who Apologizes and Who Interrupts&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Women and other non-dominant groups have been taught by Grandma to perform
ritual apologies even if they did nothing wrong. Interrupting others is also
viewed differently depending on what group you are from. Managers must be aware
of these dynamics as well as to be able to support others when their voices get
left out. However, employees must also be able to stand up for themselves and
their voices when interrupted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="mentoring">Mentoring&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Some mentoring pitfalls include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Negative stereotypes about the mentee based on race, gender, religion, etc..&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mirroring, or seeing themselves in a mentee will result in that mentee getting
special treatment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting close or potentially inappropriate relationships between mentors and
mentees are highly discouraged. Furthermore, even the appearance of an
inappropriate relationship is discouraged. For example, a male mentor taking a
female mentee out to dinner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Risk in the mentee failing and ruining both of their relationships and vice
versa. This is especially true when mentoring someone in the non-dominant
group.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resentment by others when mentoring those who are different from you,
particularly with gender roles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="chapter-5-unwritten-rules">Chapter 5: Unwritten Rules&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Organizations and group have unwritten rules and customs that everyone is
expected to follow, regardless of if everyone knows them. These rules can be
cultural, implemented informally, or be how a boss wants others to act without
explicitly saying so. If they are violated, it could cause an individual to be
demerited for something that they may not be aware of. Thus having a mentor to
guide mentees into understanding these unspoken rules is crucial.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="subtle-inequities">Subtle Inequities&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Subtle inequities are small, insignificant, and potentially undetectable
inequities that build up over time that end up haunting the organization. Some
subtle inequities involve:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Giving one employee a longer introduction than another&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leaders only talking to those that they personally know when first arriving at
divisional offices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thinking that when non-dominant groups ask questions, that they are perceived
to be lacking knowledge or confidence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Expecting that one individual to speak for all individuals who are similar to
them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not pronouncing foreign names correctly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seating your buddies next to you at meetings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Making eye contact with some people but not others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apologizing to women if you swear&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Giving certain people bigger and better projects than others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always favorably commenting on the input of specific people, but not others&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To reduce these, those in dominant groups or positions of power need to step
outside of themselves, critically evaluate their actions, and implement changes
to level the playing field for everyone. Additionally, making small changes to
reduce these subtle inequities can go a long way in improving the working
relationship and culture of an organization.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="the-danger-of-unconscious-thinking-speaking-and-acting">The Danger of Unconscious Thinking, Speaking, and Acting&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Words are the best way to get yourself into and out of trouble quickly. Thus
conscious, intentional, and mindful speaking is critical to thrive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Verbal Judo is using words to get someone to comply with or complete an action
or task. It is useful for diffusing difficult situations. Rather than order
someone to do something during a tough situation, talk to them calmly and give
them options. Instead of, &amp;ldquo;Stop that, it&amp;rsquo;s unsafe!&amp;rdquo;, a better option would be,
&amp;ldquo;For your safety and mine, please stop doing that or [insert consequence]&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking consciously means that each sentence is intentional. To American, &amp;ldquo;How
are you doing?&amp;rdquo; means basically nothing. However, to a foreigner, that is a
meaningful question and when Americans don&amp;rsquo;t listen, we are perceived as rude.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Men and women communicate information differently. Men typically prefer shorter
communication style. Hearing every single detail of a story is not as important
to them as the key takeaways. Additionally, men engage in verbal banter in a one
up/one down style where there is a winner or loser in a conversation. This
sparring is uncomfortable for some women, but is common for many men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Direct speaking (getting to the point in the most straightforward manner) is
common for those in dominant groups. Whereas indirect speaking (telling a story
to get to a point) is common for those in non-dominant groups. However, speaking
types aren&amp;rsquo;t characteristic of the entire group. But a problem arises when a
speaking type is expected of someone, but isn&amp;rsquo;t the case as this can demerit the
speaker to the listener.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chapter-7-the-tools-in-your-toolbox">Chapter 7: The Tools in Your Toolbox&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The more tools that we have to handle diversity, the better leaders we will be
within diverse organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managers need to be aware of their playing fields, or spheres of influence. They
need to be aware of who is in the dominant and non-dominant groups, whose quite
and whose loud, and what the career goals and accomplishments of individuals
are. They need to make sure everyone is heard, and that promotions are given out
based on merit and not personal relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="think-about-the-people-on-your-team">Think About the People on Your Team&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you are a manager, make sure that the events that you plan are accessible to
everyone.&lt;/p>

know each other. This could involve suppressing your Grandma.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="learn-to-recognize-other-peoples-grandmas">Learn to Recognize Other People&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Grandmas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you are a manager, ask, listen, and be aware of who everyone is on your

you give feedback to others like and unlike yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are an employee, find ways to make your voice and yourself heard to your
manager. Staying silent is not always the best answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="fair-and-equal-with-access-knowledge-and-feedback">Fair and Equal With Access, Knowledge, and Feedback&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>If you are a manager, understand that spending time with some employees means
that you don&amp;rsquo;t naturally spend time with other employees. Additionally, not

&lt;p>If you are an employee, understand the value and usefulness of having access to
your managers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you are an employee, if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak, your ideas won&amp;rsquo;t be heard. Make sure
that you either speak up when possible, or ask to speak.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once you create a Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark of diversity, then you can start reaping the
rewards of diversity. But to do so, you must be conscious of your words and
actions. Furthermore, the company&amp;rsquo;s culture must change as well to go beyond
accepting, tolerating, including, and referencing diversity. Company&amp;rsquo;s must
understand the power dynamics, subtle actions, unwritten rules, unconscious
perceptions, and backgrounds of many different groups.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;strong>National Academy of Science&lt;/strong> (NAS) (created in 1863) is a private,
non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars that are
required to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>National Academy of Engineers&lt;/strong> (NAE) (created in 1964) is a parallel
organization to NAS that also advises the federal government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Institute of Medicine&lt;/strong> (created in 1970) is a subsidiary of NAS aimed at
advising the government about public health policy matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>National Research Council&lt;/strong> was created in 1916 to broadly advise on
research matters. It is now the primary concern of both NAS and NAE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Science is built upon trust. When trust is misplaced and professional standards
are violated, researchers feel attacked and that the base of their profession
has been undermined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many new researchers are not learning about how to conduct themselves as
scientists (a broad definition that includes anyone who is involved with the
pursuit of knowledge). This task used to be placed on more senior researchers.
However, as the speed of scientific developments, this task is often placed on
the back burner. Furthermore, exciting opportunities keep appearing faster than
science can keep up, further contributing to the problem of not educating new
researchers on best practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Senior researchers have a special responsibility of upholding and promulgating
high standards in science. They should be role models, teachers, and mentors to
junior researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-note-on-using-on-being-a-scientist">A Note on Using &lt;em>On Being a Scientist&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This book explores options for handling situations, not defining what exactly to
do in a particular situation. This book should be read by a group of researchers
that discuss the topics within and figure out how to apply the lessons to their
practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The material within this book is not exhaustive, and many texts and websites now
exist to help supplement this material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The existence of professional standards implies that there is a proper way to go
about a task or field. However, this book doesn&amp;rsquo;t aim to cover specifics. To
address specific concerns, a committee consisting of a diverse group of
individuals from varying experience levels should be formed to identify and
discuss what is the professional standards. Furthermore, if your professional
has an established code of conduct or professional standards, those should be
referred to for specifics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-the-responsible-conduct-of-research">Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers pride themselves on observing or explaining phenomenon which haven&amp;rsquo;t
been seen or explained previously. However, researchers are often under a great
deal of personal and professional pressure. Failure to properly collect, report,
or handle data, experiments, or papers can result in lost time, money, and
respect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers have thus created professional standards over many centuries for
many different fields. It is therefore expected that researchers will adhere to
these standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus there is an obligation to honor the trust that their colleagues place in
them and vice versa. Irresponsible actions of others could potentially undermine
an entire field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also an obligation for researchers to conduct themselves in a
responsible manner or else face potentially permanent damage to their
reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, researchers have an obligation to the public. It is their results
that effect public policy which affects everyone. Additionally, their results
may have a butterfly effect that affects international peoples or policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;em>scientific standard&lt;/em> is the application of the ethical values of honesty,
fairness, objectivity, openness, trustworthiness, and respect for others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Scientific misconduct&lt;/em> is defined as, &amp;ldquo;fabrication, falsification or plagiarism
in proposing, performing, or reviewing researcher, or in reporting research
results,&amp;rdquo; by the US government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those that operate with &lt;em>scientific misconduct&lt;/em> are said to work with
&lt;em>questionable research practices&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>scientific standard&lt;/em> proliferates throughout the entirety of science, but
&lt;em>scientific practices&lt;/em> (application of standards) differs from field to field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advising-and-mentoring">Advising and Mentoring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is often best to build a diverse community of mentors as not one person has
the same experience, education, or background as another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a mentor is not a one way street where the mentee only benefits. As a
mentor, you experience the benefits of being exposed to new ideas, building a
strong research program and collaboration network, and gain new friends plus
respect from beginning researchers. However, mentors have influence over the
start of a junior researcher&amp;rsquo;s career, and must therefore be careful not to
abuse it. The main role of the mentor is to help the mentee move along a
productive and successful career trajectory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mentees also have responsibilities towards their mentors. They need to develop
clear expectations regarding meeting times and availability with their mentors,
and need to seek out their mentors, rather than expect a mentor to be provided
to them. For more information on this subject, please read &lt;em>Adviser, Teacher,
Role Model, Friend: On Being a Mentor to Students in Science and Engineering&lt;/em> by
Philip A. Grififths [1].&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="treatment-of-data">Treatment of Data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers who maliciously manipulate data to deceive others violate the basic
values and accepted professional standards of science. In doing so they mislead
colleagues, potentially impede progress in their field, undermine their own
authority and trustworthiness, and they introduce misinformation into both the
scientific record and the public sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure the integrity of science, researchers have developed and continually
improve upon methods such as statistical tests of significance, double-blind
trials, and proper survey phrasing ensured by the academic&amp;rsquo;s relevant Internal
Review Board (IRB). Because it is paramount that the integrity of the work is
valid, papers must include a description of the methodology used to generate the
data. This is because if the methodology to generate the data is incorrect or
not present, then the integrity of the data and the work can be called into
question. Furthermore, this helps ensure the reproducibility of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New researchers are not trained on how to generate, share, store, and publish
data. Additionally, new technologies to store, transmit, generate, and analyze
data are constantly being created. Thus researchers face a dilemma of how to
store data permanently so that it can be used in future works (either by
themselves or with others). However, when academic works are released the data
must be made available. If a researcher refuses to share the data, then they
fail to maintain the standards of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mistakes-and-negligence">Mistakes and Negligence&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All science is susceptible to error. However, researchers have an obligation to
be as accurate and as careful as possible both for their profession and the
public.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make progress, researchers must believe the works of other researchers. It is
well known that by, &amp;ldquo;looking for an answer&amp;rdquo;, or believing that there exists an
answer prior to running experiments, that researchers bias themselves to believe
that something exists when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. However, these inaccuracies and mistakes
must be remedied in the scientific record as soon as they are identified so as
to allow the continue proliferation of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="research-misconduct">Research Misconduct&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Scientific misconduct, as defined by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology
Policy, defines it as, &amp;ldquo;fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing,
performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The specific definitions for fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP)
are listed below (and taken from the text):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Fabrication is &amp;#34;making up data or results.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Falsification is &amp;#34;manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>represented in the research record.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Plagiarism is &amp;#34;the appropriation of another person&amp;#39;s ideas, processes,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>results, or words without giving appropriate credit.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Furthermore, misconduct actions significantly depart from accepted practices,
that they were intended, or knowingly, or recklessly, and have to be proven by a
preponderance of information. However, identifying the intent to deceive is
difficult to do, as honest mistakes could also result in the same generated
data. Thankfully, differences of opinion are not scientific misconduct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reduce scientific misconduct, co-authors should validate each others work, as
well as have third parties review their results prior to publication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misconduct can set back individuals, institutions, and research fields. It can
also draw the eye of the public and policy makers to make decisions that are
negative for the progression of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="responding-to-suspected-violations-of-professional-standards">Responding to Suspected Violations of Professional Standards&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Science typically self-regulates itself. It is the research community that sets
the standards and practices that researchers should follow. However, as it is
self-regulating, confrontation does occur where results are questioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When raising these questions, retaliation can occur. However, this is prohibited
by the laws do exist to prevent this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All research institutions that receive federal funding must have methods to
investigate and report misconduct. Anyone who is aware of misconduct must follow
these procedures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All scientists and research institutions should discourage questionable research
practices (QRPs). Additionally, they need to take responsibility in determining
what QRPs warren reprimands from the institution. However, not all fields define
QRPs the same. The act of salami-publishing (deliberately dividing research
results across multiple papers) is viewed differently from field to field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To raise suspicions, ask neutral questions rather than be accusatory. Another
option is to talk to a friend or advisor who can keep the situation
confidential. While this won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily result in changes, this will at least
structure your thinking in what to do next. Another option is to talk to the
research integrity officer who must be appointed if the institution receives
federal funding. However, keep in mind your own motivations and biases prior to
raising questions so as to be courteous and kind.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="human-participants-and-animal-subjects-in-research">Human Participants and Animal Subjects in Research&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Any research done on humans or animals is subject to federal, state, local, and
institutional regulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. federal regulations on experiments that involve humans is known as the
Common Rule. The Common Rule specifies exactly what falls under the domain of
human participation in experiments. Furthermore, any research institution
receiving federal grants must have an IRB. The job of the IRB is to ensure that
all research involving human participants follows the Common Rule. Many private
institutions also have IRBs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some cases where human participation is required, formal training in
bioethics is needed to identify if the experiment is ethical towards the
participants. These issues are often evaluated by the committee&amp;rsquo;s such as the
President&amp;rsquo;s Council on Bioethics in the United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animals also have federal protections with regard to animal participation in
experiments. The U.S. federal Animal Welfare Act seeks, &amp;ldquo;to insure that animals
intended for use in research facilities &amp;hellip; are provided humane care and
treatment.&amp;rdquo; The U.S. Public Health Service&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Policy on the Human Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals&lt;/em> applies to all research supported by the National
Institute of Health (NIH). This requires institutions, &amp;ldquo;to establish and
maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals
involved in research, research training, and biological testing.&amp;rdquo; The policy
requires adherence to both the Animal Welfare Act and NIH&amp;rsquo;s continually updated
&lt;em>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&lt;/em>. This requires that all
animal testing follows the three R&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Reduction in the number of animals used,

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Replacement of conscious living higher animals with insentient material
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Overseeing the ethical experimentation on animals is an institution&amp;rsquo;s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="laboratory-safety-in-research">Laboratory Safety in Research&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers should review safety information and procedures at least once a

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="sharing-of-research-results">Sharing of Research Results&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the 17th century, researchers kept their results secret in order to protect
their results from others claiming them. To solve this, Henry Oldenburg (the
secretary for the Royal Society of London) started to guarantee that not only
researchers could have their results rapidly published, but that the Royal
Society would defend authors integrity. He furthermore invented the modern
review practice of sending out manuscripts to experts prior to publication for
review.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To publish in a peer-reviewed journal is often the most important way to share
information among researchers. This is because the first to publish often gets
the credit. Once results are published, others can cite the author in their
work. Unpublished manuscripts under review are to be treated as confidential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Citations need to be scrutinized during the peer-review process in order to
assess their validity and usefulness. Researchers have a duty to thoroughly
search the available literature on a subject and attribute all relevant authors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Information can be disseminated through seminars, conferences, abstracts, and
posters as well as peer-reviewed journal papers. Often considered to be
preliminary in nature. Spreading data, results, or manuscripts that haven&amp;rsquo;t been
peer-reviewed online is possible as well. However, by bypassing traditional
quality assurance measures, researchers take on a risk that their work won&amp;rsquo;t
serve science well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Publishing or announcing results prior to peer-review is dangerous. Without the
peer-review checks, it is possible for misinformation to be misinterpreted by
the public, policy makers, and other researchers as fact. Additionally, by
posting information prior to a journal submission online, it can be considered
to be a &amp;ldquo;prior publication&amp;rdquo;, thus making it unusable for publishing within the
journal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Publication abuses are possible. For example, researchers may publish the &amp;ldquo;least
publishable unit&amp;rdquo; of information. This is when the smallest number of results
are collected or written about to be published, rather than undergoing an
intensive research process. This wastes the time and energy of reviewers and can
give the researcher a reputation of producing shoddy or incomplete work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="authorship-and-the-allocation-of-credit">Authorship and the Allocation of Credit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a paper is published, all of those that contributed to the paper are
considered authors and should be listed as such. Authorship conventions and
practices differ from field to field, and even lab to lab. Open and honest
conversations about how authorship is handled is paramount to ensure that
everyone knows the rules for the author list order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honorary authors (those that contributed zero to little actual content to the
research) should not be added in the author list. They can be acknowledged in an
&amp;ldquo;Acknowledgment&amp;rdquo; section however. Additionally, ghost-writers should not be used
to write a paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All authors on a paper must take responsibility for the content of the paper and
must be able to answer questions about the research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers should be aware of the potential monetary value that their
intellectual property has. Intellectual property is a legal right to control the
application of an idea within a specific context (through a patent) or control
the expression of an idea (through a copyright).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Patent owners can protect [their] intellectual property rights by excluding
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>others from making, using, or selling an invention so long as the patent owner
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>provides a full description of how the invention is made, is used, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>functions.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Copyrights protect the expression or presentation of ideas, but they do not
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>protect the ideas themselves.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Most research institutions have policies that detail how intellectual policy
rights should be handled. Additionally, patent and copyright laws differ from
country to country. Publication of work should not be delayed because of a
potential patent though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="competing-interests-commitments-and-values">Competing Interests, Commitments, and Values&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Conflict of interest refers to situations where researchers have personal,
intellectual, financial, and professional interests that conflict with the
ongoing research. Conflicts of financial interests undergo much scrutiny. Should
research be done with a known conflict of financial interest, it severely
damages the researcher&amp;rsquo;s credibility and integrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personal relationships can also conflict with research. Often journals and
funding agencies ask for personal relationships in order to identify potential
conflict of personal interests. Romantic relationships often count as a personal
conflict of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Timely and full disclosure of conflict of interests must be made to governing
bodies of science when requested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conflicts of commitment are different than conflict of interests. This can cause
significant strain on a researcher&amp;rsquo;s life and should be identified early.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The values that a researcher has can cause a conflict of interest as well.
Religious, philosophical, cultural, or political beliefs can all cause conflicts
of interests. Values cannot and should not be separated from science, but should
be acknowledged and understood while conducting science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-researcher-in-society">The Researcher in Society&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers have the duty to ensure that not only does their work further
science, but also improves the public&amp;rsquo;s welfare. They are put into an
interesting situation within the public sphere and may have to wear many hats.
However, it is paramount that they remain honest, fair, collegial, and open in
society as these are all core scientific tenants that researchers should follow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This book is published by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) as supplemental
material to assist in the teaching of the responsible conduct of research. The
ORI oversees and directs the Public Health Service (PHS) research integrety on
behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services as well as the American
public. This book stems from the ethics that were raised in biology related
fields in 1989 and has sinced expanded to become more general and applicable to
other disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As the importance of science and technology increases, so too has the public&amp;rsquo;s
demand for the responsible conduct of research. Simply put, this means that good
citizenship is applied to a researcher&amp;rsquo;s professional life. However, as each
field is different, so too does what &amp;ldquo;good citizenship&amp;rdquo; mean within each field.
This book was written to briefly introduce researchers to what is generally
accepted as responsible conduct regardless of their working field.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="part-i">Part I&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-1-rules-of-the-road">Chapter 1: Rules of the Road&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>There aren&amp;rsquo;t clear rules laid out to for researcher&amp;rsquo;s to easily understand what
is and isn&amp;rsquo;t responsible research conduct. Rather, there are many organizing
bodies, both official and non-official, that govern what is and isn&amp;rsquo;t
responsible. Furthermore, a researcher&amp;rsquo;s personal judgement must also solve this
ethical calculus. In order of importance of whose rules to listen too, it goes:
Professional Codes, Federal, State, institutional policies, and personal
judgement. Not all professions have Professional Codes. Federal regulations have
to first be made available for public comment in the &lt;em>Federal Register&lt;/em>, and
once accepted, are incorporated into the &lt;em>Code of Federal Regulations&lt;/em> and must
be followed. Researchers are advised to seek help in understanding Federal
rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-2-research-misconduct">Chapter 2: Research Misconduct&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Research misconduct policies provide guidance on responsible conduct in these
three areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Establish definitions for misconduct in research,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Outline procedures for reporting and investigating misconduct, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Provide protection for whistleblowers and person accused of misconduct.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Federal regulations for research misconduct technically only apply at the
Federal level, but many institutions incorporate and expand it within their own
policies. The Office of Science and Technology Policy&amp;rsquo;s (OSTP), a Federal
agenct, definition of research misconduct is, &amp;ldquo;fabrication, falsification, or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting
research results&amp;rdquo;. For an action to be considered research misconduct, it must
meet the following criteria:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Represent a, &amp;#34;significant departure from accepted practices&amp;#34;,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Have been, &amp;#34;committed intentionally, or knowingly, or recklessly&amp;#34;; and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Be, &amp;#34;proven by a prponderance of evidence&amp;#34;.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The federal policy puts the responsibility of research misconduct reporting and
investigation on both &lt;em>researchers&lt;/em> and &lt;em>their research institutions&lt;/em>. Research
misconduct puts a researcher&amp;rsquo;s career on the line. Additionally, a whistleblower
runs the risk of illegal retaliation. Furthermore, the accused researcher(s)
only face punishment when proven guilty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The violation of Federal rules, abuse of confidentiality, authorship and
publication violations, failure to report misconduct, obstruction of misconduct
investigations, and other institutional level policies can be classified as
research misconduct. It is assumed that research misconduct is under reported.
Regardless, this misconduct taints the public image of research, wastes donated
or tax-funded dollars, and harms both the professional reputations of
researchers and institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="part-ii">Part II&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-3-the-protection-of-human-subjects">Chapter 3: The Protection of Human Subjects&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Human subjects are used in order to find improvements to the human experience.
This could involve the creation of new medicines, surgeries, or experiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers who use human subjects are subject to Federal regulations. Both the
Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki are guidelines that are to be
followed when testing on human subjects. Additionally, the Federal regulation 45
CFR 46 Subparts A - D, known as the &amp;ldquo;Common Rule&amp;rdquo;, are expected to be followed
as well. Exempt research from the &amp;ldquo;Common Rule&amp;rdquo; include:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or subject to the
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>approval of department or agency heads; or
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Any institution that performs human research must have a Federally mandated
Internal Review Board (IRB) consisting of at least 5 people, one of which is a
scientist, one of which is a non-scientist, and one who is not affiliated with
the institution. Furthermore, all researchers working with human subjects must
undergo National Institutes of Health (NIH) training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All human subjects must have to informed consent and the right to withdraw.
Furthermore, there is an ethical concern in human subjects research that some
experiments have risks without any benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-4-the-welfare-of-laboratory-animals">Chapter 4: The Welfare of Laboratory Animals&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Research on animal subjects is done to benefit humans without experimenting on
humans. The 1966 Animal Welfare Act and the 1985 Health and Research Extension
Act both act as Federal regulations that researcher&amp;rsquo;s experimenting on human
subjects must abide by. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is
responsible for the transportation, care, and use of animals. The usage of
animals for biomedical and behavioral research is subject to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), NIH.
Furthermore, activists have put together guidelines through the Animal Care
Panel (ACP) commonly reffered to as th Guide. The &lt;em>Guide&lt;/em> is widely accepted
both in public and private institutions as well as Federal laboratories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The definition of an animal from the PHS Policy is, &amp;ldquo;any live, vertebrate
animals used or inteded for use in research, research training, experimentation,
or biological testing or for related purposes&amp;rdquo;. the definition of an animal from
the Common Rule that implements the Animal Welfare Act includes warm blooded
animals (mammals) but excludes, &amp;ldquo;Birds, rats of the genus Rattus and mice of the
genus Mus bred for use in research, and horses not used for research purposes
and other farm animals&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Institutions testing on animals must create an Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) which acts similarly to an IRB but for animals. These, along
with the OLAW, USDA, and accrediation programs, are responsible for the proper
care and respect of animal subjects. Prior to using animal subjects, researchers
must defend the usage of animal subjects against the &amp;ldquo;three R&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Replacement - using non-animal models such asmicroorganisms or cell culture
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>techniques, computer simulations, or species lower on the phulogenetic scale,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Reduction - using methods aimed at reducing the numbers of animals such as
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>minimization of variability, appropriate selection of animal model, minimization

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Refinement - the elimination or reduction of unnecessary pain and distress
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[in animal subjects].
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="chapter-5-conflicts-of-interest">Chapter 5: Conflicts of Interest&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Researchers can experience three different types of conflicts of interest:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Financial gain,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Work commitments, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Intellectual and personal matters.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Financial gains involve reciving money from an institute that the researcher has
a vested in. This could involve having stock in the company, or being a member
of the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work commitments involve colluding multiple working positions into one in order
to serve a singular purpose. In other words, if a position at work is being used
to further a research objective or vice versa, it is a conflict of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellectual and personal matter conflicts of interest occur when the idealogy,
beliefs, or viewpoint of a researcher could interfere with their research
objectives. As an example (not mentioned in this book; purely my own thought
probably taken from someone else) is a pro-life reseacher working on
abortificants.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="part-iii">Part III&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-6-data-management-practices">Chapter 6: Data Management Practices&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Research is not possible without data. Because of this, there are
responsibilities that researchers have to the proper ownership, collection,
storage, and sharing of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data can be owned by one or many sources. This includes the funders of the
research, the institution where the research was conducted, and the original
source of the data. Typically, government funded research allows the data to be
shared for the public good, privately funded research retain the right to
disseminate the data, and philinthropic funding sources retain or give away
their data ownership rights depending on their motive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data must be collected responsibly. This means that data collection method is
appropriate and reliable. If the method is garbage, the result will be garbage
(garbage in, garbage out). The data collected must be detailed enough to support
the results. It must also be authorized for collection, and when recorded,
proper metadata must be captured to include the date, time, source, and other
important facts about the source of the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After collecting the data, data must be stored properly so as to prevent the
theivery or loss of data. This includes securing lab notebooks and regularly
backing up data files. Additionally, any data that includes personal identifying
information or is otherwise confidential, must go through a process of
anonymizing the data so as to respect the source&amp;rsquo;s privacy. Furthermore, some
data may be subject to a period of retention and if not, data should otherwise
be retained indefinetly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of sharing data with other researchers or the general public, data
must be fully validated, not be preliminary data, and can be confidential until
publication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, future considerations about the data must be taken into account. For
example, the generated data of an experiment can be larger than the amount of
usable computer storage. Furthermore, there is now a concern that released data
can contribute to the terrorism or foreign entities that wish to do harm to the
American public. Ethical concerns about the release of such data must be taken
into consideration prior to releasing said data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-7-mentor-and-trainee-responsibilities">Chapter 7: Mentor and Trainee Responsibilities&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Trainee refers to anyone learning to be a researcher learning from a senior
researcher. To establish the basic understandings of the relationship, trainees
must know from their mentors:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How much time they are expected to put into research,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How performance is judged,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How responsibilities are shared or divided,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Standard operating procedures, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How credit and authorship are assigned.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Whereas mentors expect from their trainees that they:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Do work in a conscientious way,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Respect the authority of others,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Follow research regulations and protocols, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Live by agreements established for authorship and ownership
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>To make sure these expectations are clear, the mentor should lay them out
initally. Furthermore, mentors have are expected to supervise the work of a
trainee. This results in the monitoring, support, and review of a trainees work,
as well as imparting the ethos of being a researcher onto them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The research environment that they mentor creates and the trainee learns in
should be one of:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Equal treatment free from discrimination,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Professional, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Follow the responsible conduct of research
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Postdoctoral researchers have a rough time in the lab as they have the skills to
be an independent researcher, but since they are no longer students nor faculty,
they have little rights. Additionally, since they are working under someone
else&amp;rsquo;s funding, they have little freedom to pursue their own research. The
National Postdoctoral Association has been created to ensure that postdocs have
the rights that they deserve with respect to transitioning to independent
researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-8-collaborative-research">Chapter 8: Collaborative Research&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Collaborative research involves any time when two or more researchers
collaborate on the same project. This could involve researchers from the same
institution or different insititutions. This work is led by a primary
investigator (PI) who heads the project and is responsible for the compliance of
rules and responsible research conduct, financials, and training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collaborative research projects need to initially solve many problems with
respect to:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The goals of the project and anticipated outcomes,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Everyone&amp;#39;s role,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How data will be collected, stored, and shared,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How changes in the research design will be made,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Who is responsible for drafting publications,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The criteria to identify and rank authorship,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Who is responsible for submitting reports and meeting other requirements,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Who is responsible for publicly speaking about the work,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How intellectural property rights and ownership issues will be resolved, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How collaboration can be changed and when it comes ot an end.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>With respect to compliance, it is best practice to work under the compliance
guidelines of the institution or state that has the strictest policies to ensure
that all researchers are following proper protocol.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All forms of publication should present:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A full and fair description of the work done,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- An accurate report of the results,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- An honest and open assessment of the findings,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The methods of the researcher,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- What the results are, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A discussion of the results to better understand their impact.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Authorship serves to let others know who conducted the research and should get
credit for it. It is generally limited to those who were:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Intimately involved in the conception and design of the research,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Assumed responsibility for data collection and interpretation,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Participated in the drafting of the publication, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Approved the final version of the publication.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>There is disagreement as to whether a researcher needs to adhere to all of these
rules in order to be consider an author. The International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors (ICMJE) have created the &lt;em>Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts
Submitted to Biomedical Journals&lt;/em> which lists out the following criteria for
authorship:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>or analysis and interpretation of data,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>content, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Final approval of the version to be published
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The ICMJE guidelines are strict and are not followed by all disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first and last author on a paper carry weight. What this weight means is
dependent upon the field that it is published in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The corresponding or primary author of the paper is the individual who can
intimately describe the work and is the public relations individual of the work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A manuscript should include:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- An abstract to summarize the content of the paper,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A methods section to describe the research methods to create the results,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A results section to talk about what was found,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A discussion section to describe what the results mean, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A notes, bibliography, and acknowledgments section to acknowledge the work of
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>previous researchers or minor authors to the paper
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The following authorship practices should be avoided:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Honorary authorship,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Salami publications (using the same data/ study in two seperate papers),
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Duplicate publications, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Premature public statments
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="chapter-10-peer-review">Chapter 10: Peer Review&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Peer reviewed is done by fellow researchers (typically within the same field) to
asses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Grant reviews,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manuscript reviews,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Personnel reviews, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Literature reviews and expert testimony&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Peer reviews must be:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Timely,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Thorough,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Constructive,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Free from personal bias, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Respectful of the need for confidentiality
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Peer reviews assess the quality of the work by:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Assessing whether the research methods are appropriate,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Checking calculations and/or confirming the logic of important arguments,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Making sure the conclusions are supported by the evidence presented, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Confirming that the relevant literature has bee consulted and cited
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Research quality can be comprimised if the peer reviewer(s) find:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Careless mistakes made in reporting data and/or listing citations,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The deliberate favrication and falsification of data,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Plagarism
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Inaccurate reporting of conflicts of interest, contributors/ authors, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The failure to mention important prior work, either by others of by the
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>researcher submitting a paper for publication.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Peer reviews judge the importance of the work by answering the following
questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Assuming a researcher could carry out a proposed research project, is it
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>important to do so?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Are these research results important enough to publish?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Has a researcher made important contributions to a field of study?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Is this evidence important enough to be used in setting policy?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>By juding importance, a reviewers personal bias is involved. To mitigate this,
reviewers should write transparent reviews in which they lay out their bias as
well as any documents or citations that they found that supports their bias.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Confidentiality is important in protecting peers from attacks from one another.
There exists a double-blind review in which both the reviewers and the authors
are anonymous from one another. It is not appropriate to:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Ask students or anyone else to conduct a review you were asked to do,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Use an idea or information contained in a grant proposal or unpublished
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>manuscript before it becomes publicly available,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Discuss grant proposals or manuscripts you are reviewing with colleagues in
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>your department or at a professional meeting,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Retain a copy of the reviewed mateial, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Discuss personnel and hiring decisions with colleagues who are not part of the
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>review process
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;hr>

&lt;p>It is well understood that many people early in their career have irresponsible
research conduct. Additionally, what might be considered responsible conduct in
one field may not apply to all fields. None the less, there is no justification
for comprimising the core tennants of research: honesty, accuracy, efficiency,
and objectivity. Upholding these is the responsibility of all researchers.&lt;/p>
