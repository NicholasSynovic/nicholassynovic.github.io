headings, and conclusion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks&lt;/em> by
Krizhevsky et al. discusses the AlexNet model and its architecture as well as
its SOTA achievements in the 2012 ImageNet Challenge. The difference between
AlexNet and other contestants was that the model relies on GPU training to train
the convulational neural network model. By utilizing the GPU, training time can
be accelerated significatnly more than what was previously possible. Their major
contributions is that a large, deep convulational neural network is capable of
achieving record-breaking resuls via supervised learning. They did not utilize
unsupervised pre-training, but the authors suspect that it would improve the
accuracy of the model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="category">Category&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What type of paper is this work?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a computer vision model evaluation and architecture paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="context">Context&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What other &lt;em>types&lt;/em> of papers is the work related to?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This paper is similar to others that have published about SOTA results from the
ImageNet Challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="contributions">Contributions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What are the author&amp;rsquo;s main contributions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Their main contributions were that training on GPUs allows for accelerated
training, that large and deep convulutional neural networks are effective at
clasifying images, and that removing layers does decrease the performance of
models. Therefore, a larger, deeper model is applicable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What has been done prior to this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Previous work on designing convulational neural networks and architectures.
However, they were bounded by not being particularly deep.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Because it is one of the key papers that demonstrates that large, deep,
convulational neural networks are effective for image classification. As well as
providing evidence that training on GPUs is not only effective but recommended
for optimal performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Nearly all of the figures are designed well, with the exception of Figure 2.
Figure 2 is the model architecture of AlexNet. This figure suffers from
information density and a three dimensional design which makes it hard to
determin what is going on and in what dimension are images being manipulated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition&lt;/em>
by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zissernman discusses the SOTA performance of their
model in the 2014 ImageNet Challenge on localisation and classification tasks.
They discuss that be extending the depth of convolutional neural networks to 16
up to 19 layers, with a 3x3 filter size, SOTA performance is possible without
redeveloping the architecture of existing convolutional neural networks. This is
in contrast to &lt;a href="going-deeper-with-convolutions.md">Szegedy&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a> who proposes
the Inception architecture for classification and object detection; with which
the reference implementation also came first in the 2014 ImageNet Challenge in
its respective tasks. Simoyan et al. discuss the architecture and training that
went into their model (VGG) and how to architect future models to perform as
well or better.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We should care about the authors work as increasing the depth of a neural
network by their proposed architecture allows for easy expansion of existing
convulational neural networks without redesigning the libraries used to create
them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The tables that are presented are easy to read, but can be improved upon. Often,
multiple rows will correspond with a single model configuration. This is fine,
however, it is difficult to make out what configuration each row corresponds to.
Additionally, the tables make comparing error percentages easy across model
configurations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I would love to try and optimize the input layer of convulational neural
networks by having a computation that not only looks at the color space, but
also the opacity of an image. This would allow for images to have their
background removed for the purposes of classification by making the background
less opaque than the foreground.&lt;/p>

work builds of previous efforts of improving convulational neural network
performance by optimizing the filter size and intial layer, but contrasts
contemporaries [2] by not developing a new architecture. Their work has
importance as it shows that the existing convulational neural network
architecture is capable of SOTA performance by increasing the depth of the
model. They justify this by trying six different model configurations, and
finding that models with 16 to 19 layers performed best on the 2014 ImageNet
Challenge classification and localisation challenges.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Going deeper with convolutions&lt;/em> by Christian Szegedy et al. [1]
describes a 2014 state of the art computer vision model (on the ImageNet
Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) called GoogLeNet architected based on
Hebbian principles (i.e. neruons that fire together, are wired together)and a
constant computational budget. Their approach relies on creative algorithms and
neuroscience principles and aims to be a more power effiecient model for mobile
devices by limiting the computations during infrencing. Additionally, their
model is deep but not wide and is considered &amp;ldquo;sparse&amp;rdquo; by the authors. In other
words, there are as few nodes as possible within the neural network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Szegedy et al.&amp;rsquo;s contributions are a state of the art computer vision model that
provides experimental evidence that, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; Approximating the expected optimal
sparse structure by readily avilible dense building blocks is a viable method
for improving neural networks for computer vision&amp;rdquo;. This means that this model
proves that dense neural networks for computer vision are not necessary in the
author&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What are the author&amp;rsquo;s main contributions?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Szegedy et al.&amp;rsquo;s contributions are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A computer vision model architecture (Inception) that is both sparse and aims
to be computationally efficient on mobile (non-server) devices,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A reference model of the aforementioned computer vision model architecture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A comparison of previous state of the art work to justify their claims that
sparser networks are the future of computer vision models.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>All of the tables have proper column labels. However, Table 1 does not provide
default values for blank cells. This is most likely due to the layer type not
performaing a specific operation (as described in the column label). Regardless,
the remaining tables look good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, Figure 3 is very clear to read, if a little dense. However, as it
describes all of the layers of GoogLeNet and how they are connected, I find the
size to be appropriate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="clarity">Clarity&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is the paper well written?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper is fairly well written. The only complaints that I have are minor
grammatical mistakes that the author&amp;rsquo;s left in (by accident I assume).
Additionally, that the authors didn&amp;rsquo;t optimize their tables and figures to
better fit on the pages. As tables and figures are stacked on top of one
another, it would be possible to reclaim paper space by rearranging multiple
tables and figures to be next to one another, with the exception of Figure 3 due
to the sheer size of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="author-assumptions">Author Assumptions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One assumption that the authors make is that overfitting is more prone to occur
in large models. Additionally, overfitting can occur when there is not enough
labeled examples in a dataset when a large model is training. Furthermore,
increasing the size of a model increases the number of computations that must be
done between layers (e.g. chaining two convulational layers results in
computation cost quadratically increasing) Their solutions relies on moving from
fully connected to sparsely connected architectures including within
convolutional layers. Also, their model architecutre is based on the idea that
computers are inefficent when, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; Computing numerical calculations on
non-uniform sparse data structures&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They assume that 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 filters are the proper filters to use, but
did not test other size of filters. They also assume that using, &amp;ldquo;Inception
modules&amp;rdquo; is only useful at higher levels, whereas the initial levels are
standard convultational levels. However, this was not tested either and was due
to, &amp;ldquo;infrastructural inefficiences&amp;rdquo; in the implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, that the model that achieved state of the art performance was the best
model. The authors had been training and testing other models for months prior,
however, it is unclear what the testing methodology was and why a particular
model was choosen to compete in the ImageNet competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="correctness">Correctness&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do the assumptions seem valid?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The first paragraph of assumptions seems reasonable and correct. However, the
remaining two paragraphs seem unreasonable. This is due to the lack of testing
that the author&amp;rsquo;s put in when optimizing their model with respect to the filter
sizes and choosing models. Furthermore, if testing did occur to address these
issues, it is not addressed in this paper, thus leaving the reader to wonder why
testing wasn&amp;rsquo;t performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My own proposed future directions for the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Based off of Section 3 (Motiviation and High Level Considerations), one
promising area of study would be to perform a network architecture search
utilizing the principles and reasoning of their approach to other machine
learning and computer vision domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An enhancement to their work is possible by analyzing what filter sizes most
optimal improve performance. Currently the author&amp;rsquo;s are restricting GoogLeNet to
1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 filter sizes, but this was due to convience and no data was
given to support this.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A summary of the paper&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Going deeper with convolutions&lt;/em> by Szegedy et al. [1] introduces a
computer vision model architecture called Inception and a reference model called
GoogLeNet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inception is a model architecuture that is both sparse and (attempts to be)
computationally efficent during inferencing with only 1.5 billion multiply-add
operations allowed. Inception models are composed of multiple Inception modules
that are stacked on top of each other. Each Inception module takes in data from
the previous layer and passes it into small convultional filters (i.e. 1x1
typically). There are three of these small filters that are wired to the input
of the Inception module, with one of them connected directly to the output. The
outputs of two of these filters are then passed into larger filters (i.e. 5x5)
to which it is then passed into a DepthConcat function. Additionally, a 3x3
filter is wired to the input of the module and the output of which goes into a
1x1 filter to be passed into the DepthConcat function as well. From there, it is
passed into another Inception module and the process repeats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> Depth when referring to two dimensional images refers to the color
channel of the image. As images typically have three color channels (i.e. red,
green, blue), an image would have a depth of 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Example:&lt;/em> A 200 pixel by 200 pixel full color spectrum image would be
represented as 200x200x3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible for Inception modules to have an additional connection to the
input of the module to perform average pooling for softmax activation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GoogLeNet achieved SOTA performance in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge image classification task by having a top-5 error of 6.67%
on both the validation and testing data. This is an improvment of 56.5% in
comparison to 2012&amp;rsquo;s SOTA performer (SuperVision) and 2013&amp;rsquo;s SOTA performer
(Clarifai). Additionally, they achieved SOTA perfomance for the ImageNet
Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge detection task with a mean average
precision of 43.9% utilizing an ensemble inference approach. This model was
architected using the Inception architecture with 22 layers. However, not every
layer was an Inception module; the first few layers were standard convulational
layers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author&amp;rsquo;s contributions were as follows;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The Inception computer vision architecture,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The GoogLeNet SOTA computer vision model for classification and object
detection.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>My opinion on this paper is that while it is well written, the author&amp;rsquo;s make
numerous assumptions about the optimal performance of their model&amp;rsquo;s
architecture. They don&amp;rsquo;t test optimal sizes for filters as well as resolving
bugs such as the usage of standard convulational layers early in the model. Both
of which can be solved by performing a neural architecture search.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Future work for this paper would involve optimizing the model architecture via a
neural architecture search. As well as evaluating the performance of the model
by both increasing and decreasing the depth of the model.&lt;/p>
