&lt;p>The &lt;strong>National Academy of Science&lt;/strong> (NAS) (created in 1863) is a private,
non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars that are
required to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>National Academy of Engineers&lt;/strong> (NAE) (created in 1964) is a parallel
organization to NAS that also advises the federal government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Institute of Medicine&lt;/strong> (created in 1970) is a subsidiary of NAS aimed at
advising the government about public health policy matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>National Research Council&lt;/strong> was created in 1916 to broadly advise on
research matters. It is now the primary concern of both NAS and NAE.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Science is built upon trust. When trust is misplaced and professional standards
are violated, researchers feel attacked and that the base of their profession
has been undermined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many new researchers are not learning about how to conduct themselves as
scientists (a broad definition that includes anyone who is involved with the
pursuit of knowledge). This task used to be placed on more senior researchers.
However, as the speed of scientific developments, this task is often placed on
the back burner. Furthermore, exciting opportunities keep appearing faster than
science can keep up, further contributing to the problem of not educating new
researchers on best practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Senior researchers have a special responsibility of upholding and promulgating
high standards in science. They should be role models, teachers, and mentors to
junior researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-note-on-using-on-being-a-scientist">A Note on Using &lt;em>On Being a Scientist&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This book explores options for handling situations, not defining what exactly to
do in a particular situation. This book should be read by a group of researchers
that discuss the topics within and figure out how to apply the lessons to their
practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The material within this book is not exhaustive, and many texts and websites now
exist to help supplement this material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The existence of professional standards implies that there is a proper way to go
about a task or field. However, this book doesn&amp;rsquo;t aim to cover specifics. To
address specific concerns, a committee consisting of a diverse group of
individuals from varying experience levels should be formed to identify and
discuss what is the professional standards. Furthermore, if your professional
has an established code of conduct or professional standards, those should be
referred to for specifics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-the-responsible-conduct-of-research">Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers pride themselves on observing or explaining phenomenon which haven&amp;rsquo;t
been seen or explained previously. However, researchers are often under a great
deal of personal and professional pressure. Failure to properly collect, report,
or handle data, experiments, or papers can result in lost time, money, and
respect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers have thus created professional standards over many centuries for
many different fields. It is therefore expected that researchers will adhere to
these standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus there is an obligation to honor the trust that their colleagues place in
them and vice versa. Irresponsible actions of others could potentially undermine
an entire field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also an obligation for researchers to conduct themselves in a
responsible manner or else face potentially permanent damage to their
reputation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, researchers have an obligation to the public. It is their results
that effect public policy which affects everyone. Additionally, their results
may have a butterfly effect that affects international peoples or policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;em>scientific standard&lt;/em> is the application of the ethical values of honesty,
fairness, objectivity, openness, trustworthiness, and respect for others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Scientific misconduct&lt;/em> is defined as, &amp;ldquo;fabrication, falsification or plagiarism
in proposing, performing, or reviewing researcher, or in reporting research
results,&amp;rdquo; by the US government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those that operate with &lt;em>scientific misconduct&lt;/em> are said to work with
&lt;em>questionable research practices&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>scientific standard&lt;/em> proliferates throughout the entirety of science, but
&lt;em>scientific practices&lt;/em> (application of standards) differs from field to field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advising-and-mentoring">Advising and Mentoring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is often best to build a diverse community of mentors as not one person has
the same experience, education, or background as another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a mentor is not a one way street where the mentee only benefits. As a
mentor, you experience the benefits of being exposed to new ideas, building a
strong research program and collaboration network, and gain new friends plus
respect from beginning researchers. However, mentors have influence over the
start of a junior researcher&amp;rsquo;s career, and must therefore be careful not to
abuse it. The main role of the mentor is to help the mentee move along a
productive and successful career trajectory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mentees also have responsibilities towards their mentors. They need to develop
clear expectations regarding meeting times and availability with their mentors,
and need to seek out their mentors, rather than expect a mentor to be provided
to them. For more information on this subject, please read &lt;em>Adviser, Teacher,
Role Model, Friend: On Being a Mentor to Students in Science and Engineering&lt;/em> by
Philip A. Grififths [1].&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="treatment-of-data">Treatment of Data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers who maliciously manipulate data to deceive others violate the basic
values and accepted professional standards of science. In doing so they mislead
colleagues, potentially impede progress in their field, undermine their own
authority and trustworthiness, and they introduce misinformation into both the
scientific record and the public sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure the integrity of science, researchers have developed and continually
improve upon methods such as statistical tests of significance, double-blind
trials, and proper survey phrasing ensured by the academic&amp;rsquo;s relevant Internal
Review Board (IRB). Because it is paramount that the integrity of the work is
valid, papers must include a description of the methodology used to generate the
data. This is because if the methodology to generate the data is incorrect or
not present, then the integrity of the data and the work can be called into
question. Furthermore, this helps ensure the reproducibility of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New researchers are not trained on how to generate, share, store, and publish
data. Additionally, new technologies to store, transmit, generate, and analyze
data are constantly being created. Thus researchers face a dilemma of how to
store data permanently so that it can be used in future works (either by
themselves or with others). However, when academic works are released the data
must be made available. If a researcher refuses to share the data, then they
fail to maintain the standards of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mistakes-and-negligence">Mistakes and Negligence&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All science is susceptible to error. However, researchers have an obligation to
be as accurate and as careful as possible both for their profession and the
public.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make progress, researchers must believe the works of other researchers. It is
well known that by, &amp;ldquo;looking for an answer&amp;rdquo;, or believing that there exists an
answer prior to running experiments, that researchers bias themselves to believe
that something exists when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. However, these inaccuracies and mistakes
must be remedied in the scientific record as soon as they are identified so as
to allow the continue proliferation of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="research-misconduct">Research Misconduct&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Scientific misconduct, as defined by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology
Policy, defines it as, &amp;ldquo;fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing,
performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The specific definitions for fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP)
are listed below (and taken from the text):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Fabrication is &amp;#34;making up data or results.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Falsification is &amp;#34;manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>represented in the research record.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Plagiarism is &amp;#34;the appropriation of another person&amp;#39;s ideas, processes,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>results, or words without giving appropriate credit.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Furthermore, misconduct actions significantly depart from accepted practices,
that they were intended, or knowingly, or recklessly, and have to be proven by a
preponderance of information. However, identifying the intent to deceive is
difficult to do, as honest mistakes could also result in the same generated
data. Thankfully, differences of opinion are not scientific misconduct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reduce scientific misconduct, co-authors should validate each others work, as
well as have third parties review their results prior to publication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misconduct can set back individuals, institutions, and research fields. It can
also draw the eye of the public and policy makers to make decisions that are
negative for the progression of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="responding-to-suspected-violations-of-professional-standards">Responding to Suspected Violations of Professional Standards&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Science typically self-regulates itself. It is the research community that sets
the standards and practices that researchers should follow. However, as it is
self-regulating, confrontation does occur where results are questioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When raising these questions, retaliation can occur. However, this is prohibited
by the laws do exist to prevent this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All research institutions that receive federal funding must have methods to
investigate and report misconduct. Anyone who is aware of misconduct must follow
these procedures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All scientists and research institutions should discourage questionable research
practices (QRPs). Additionally, they need to take responsibility in determining
what QRPs warren reprimands from the institution. However, not all fields define
QRPs the same. The act of salami-publishing (deliberately dividing research
results across multiple papers) is viewed differently from field to field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To raise suspicions, ask neutral questions rather than be accusatory. Another
option is to talk to a friend or advisor who can keep the situation
confidential. While this won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily result in changes, this will at least
structure your thinking in what to do next. Another option is to talk to the
research integrity officer who must be appointed if the institution receives
federal funding. However, keep in mind your own motivations and biases prior to
raising questions so as to be courteous and kind.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="human-participants-and-animal-subjects-in-research">Human Participants and Animal Subjects in Research&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Any research done on humans or animals is subject to federal, state, local, and
institutional regulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. federal regulations on experiments that involve humans is known as the
Common Rule. The Common Rule specifies exactly what falls under the domain of
human participation in experiments. Furthermore, any research institution
receiving federal grants must have an IRB. The job of the IRB is to ensure that
all research involving human participants follows the Common Rule. Many private
institutions also have IRBs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some cases where human participation is required, formal training in
bioethics is needed to identify if the experiment is ethical towards the
participants. These issues are often evaluated by the committee&amp;rsquo;s such as the
President&amp;rsquo;s Council on Bioethics in the United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animals also have federal protections with regard to animal participation in
experiments. The U.S. federal Animal Welfare Act seeks, &amp;ldquo;to insure that animals
intended for use in research facilities &amp;hellip; are provided humane care and
treatment.&amp;rdquo; The U.S. Public Health Service&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Policy on the Human Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals&lt;/em> applies to all research supported by the National
Institute of Health (NIH). This requires institutions, &amp;ldquo;to establish and
maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals
involved in research, research training, and biological testing.&amp;rdquo; The policy
requires adherence to both the Animal Welfare Act and NIH&amp;rsquo;s continually updated
&lt;em>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&lt;/em>. This requires that all
animal testing follows the three R&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Reduction in the number of animals used,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Refinement of techniques and procedures to reduce pain and distress,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Replacement of conscious living higher animals with insentient material
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Overseeing the ethical experimentation on animals is an institution&amp;rsquo;s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="laboratory-safety-in-research">Laboratory Safety in Research&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers should review safety information and procedures at least once a
year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A shortlist of topics to review includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Appropriate usage of protective equipment and clothing,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safe handling of materials in laboratories,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safe operation of equipment,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safe disposal of materials,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safety management and accountability,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Hazard assessment processes,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safe transportation of materials between laboratories,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safe design of facilities,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Emergency responses,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Safety education of all personnel before entering the laboratory,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Applicable government regulations
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="sharing-of-research-results">Sharing of Research Results&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the 17th century, researchers kept their results secret in order to protect
their results from others claiming them. To solve this, Henry Oldenburg (the
secretary for the Royal Society of London) started to guarantee that not only
researchers could have their results rapidly published, but that the Royal
Society would defend authors integrity. He furthermore invented the modern
review practice of sending out manuscripts to experts prior to publication for
review.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To publish in a peer-reviewed journal is often the most important way to share
information among researchers. This is because the first to publish often gets
the credit. Once results are published, others can cite the author in their
work. Unpublished manuscripts under review are to be treated as confidential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Citations need to be scrutinized during the peer-review process in order to
assess their validity and usefulness. Researchers have a duty to thoroughly
search the available literature on a subject and attribute all relevant authors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Information can be disseminated through seminars, conferences, abstracts, and
posters as well as peer-reviewed journal papers. Often considered to be
preliminary in nature. Spreading data, results, or manuscripts that haven&amp;rsquo;t been
peer-reviewed online is possible as well. However, by bypassing traditional
quality assurance measures, researchers take on a risk that their work won&amp;rsquo;t
serve science well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Publishing or announcing results prior to peer-review is dangerous. Without the
peer-review checks, it is possible for misinformation to be misinterpreted by
the public, policy makers, and other researchers as fact. Additionally, by
posting information prior to a journal submission online, it can be considered
to be a &amp;ldquo;prior publication&amp;rdquo;, thus making it unusable for publishing within the
journal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Publication abuses are possible. For example, researchers may publish the &amp;ldquo;least
publishable unit&amp;rdquo; of information. This is when the smallest number of results
are collected or written about to be published, rather than undergoing an
intensive research process. This wastes the time and energy of reviewers and can
give the researcher a reputation of producing shoddy or incomplete work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="authorship-and-the-allocation-of-credit">Authorship and the Allocation of Credit&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a paper is published, all of those that contributed to the paper are
considered authors and should be listed as such. Authorship conventions and
practices differ from field to field, and even lab to lab. Open and honest
conversations about how authorship is handled is paramount to ensure that
everyone knows the rules for the author list order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honorary authors (those that contributed zero to little actual content to the
research) should not be added in the author list. They can be acknowledged in an
&amp;ldquo;Acknowledgment&amp;rdquo; section however. Additionally, ghost-writers should not be used
to write a paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All authors on a paper must take responsibility for the content of the paper and
must be able to answer questions about the research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers should be aware of the potential monetary value that their
intellectual property has. Intellectual property is a legal right to control the
application of an idea within a specific context (through a patent) or control
the expression of an idea (through a copyright).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Patent owners can protect [their] intellectual property rights by excluding
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>others from making, using, or selling an invention so long as the patent owner
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>provides a full description of how the invention is made, is used, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>functions.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Copyrights protect the expression or presentation of ideas, but they do not
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>protect the ideas themselves.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Most research institutions have policies that detail how intellectual policy
rights should be handled. Additionally, patent and copyright laws differ from
country to country. Publication of work should not be delayed because of a
potential patent though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="competing-interests-commitments-and-values">Competing Interests, Commitments, and Values&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Conflict of interest refers to situations where researchers have personal,
intellectual, financial, and professional interests that conflict with the
ongoing research. Conflicts of financial interests undergo much scrutiny. Should
research be done with a known conflict of financial interest, it severely
damages the researcher&amp;rsquo;s credibility and integrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personal relationships can also conflict with research. Often journals and
funding agencies ask for personal relationships in order to identify potential
conflict of personal interests. Romantic relationships often count as a personal
conflict of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Timely and full disclosure of conflict of interests must be made to governing
bodies of science when requested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conflicts of commitment are different than conflict of interests. This can cause
significant strain on a researcher&amp;rsquo;s life and should be identified early.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The values that a researcher has can cause a conflict of interest as well.
Religious, philosophical, cultural, or political beliefs can all cause conflicts
of interests. Values cannot and should not be separated from science, but should
be acknowledged and understood while conducting science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-researcher-in-society">The Researcher in Society&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Researchers have the duty to ensure that not only does their work further
science, but also improves the public&amp;rsquo;s welfare. They are put into an
interesting situation within the public sphere and may have to wear many hats.
However, it is paramount that they remain honest, fair, collegial, and open in
society as these are all core scientific tenants that researchers should follow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This book is published by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) as supplemental
material to assist in the teaching of the responsible conduct of research. The
ORI oversees and directs the Public Health Service (PHS) research integrety on
behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services as well as the American
public. This book stems from the ethics that were raised in biology related
fields in 1989 and has sinced expanded to become more general and applicable to
other disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As the importance of science and technology increases, so too has the public&amp;rsquo;s
demand for the responsible conduct of research. Simply put, this means that good
citizenship is applied to a researcher&amp;rsquo;s professional life. However, as each
field is different, so too does what &amp;ldquo;good citizenship&amp;rdquo; mean within each field.
This book was written to briefly introduce researchers to what is generally
accepted as responsible conduct regardless of their working field.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="part-i">Part I&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-1-rules-of-the-road">Chapter 1: Rules of the Road&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>There aren&amp;rsquo;t clear rules laid out to for researcher&amp;rsquo;s to easily understand what
is and isn&amp;rsquo;t responsible research conduct. Rather, there are many organizing
bodies, both official and non-official, that govern what is and isn&amp;rsquo;t
responsible. Furthermore, a researcher&amp;rsquo;s personal judgement must also solve this
ethical calculus. In order of importance of whose rules to listen too, it goes:
Professional Codes, Federal, State, institutional policies, and personal
judgement. Not all professions have Professional Codes. Federal regulations have
to first be made available for public comment in the &lt;em>Federal Register&lt;/em>, and
once accepted, are incorporated into the &lt;em>Code of Federal Regulations&lt;/em> and must
be followed. Researchers are advised to seek help in understanding Federal
rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-2-research-misconduct">Chapter 2: Research Misconduct&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Research misconduct policies provide guidance on responsible conduct in these
three areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Establish definitions for misconduct in research,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Outline procedures for reporting and investigating misconduct, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Provide protection for whistleblowers and person accused of misconduct.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Federal regulations for research misconduct technically only apply at the
Federal level, but many institutions incorporate and expand it within their own
policies. The Office of Science and Technology Policy&amp;rsquo;s (OSTP), a Federal
agenct, definition of research misconduct is, &amp;ldquo;fabrication, falsification, or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting
research results&amp;rdquo;. For an action to be considered research misconduct, it must
meet the following criteria:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Represent a, &amp;#34;significant departure from accepted practices&amp;#34;,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Have been, &amp;#34;committed intentionally, or knowingly, or recklessly&amp;#34;; and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Be, &amp;#34;proven by a prponderance of evidence&amp;#34;.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The federal policy puts the responsibility of research misconduct reporting and
investigation on both &lt;em>researchers&lt;/em> and &lt;em>their research institutions&lt;/em>. Research
misconduct puts a researcher&amp;rsquo;s career on the line. Additionally, a whistleblower
runs the risk of illegal retaliation. Furthermore, the accused researcher(s)
only face punishment when proven guilty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The violation of Federal rules, abuse of confidentiality, authorship and
publication violations, failure to report misconduct, obstruction of misconduct
investigations, and other institutional level policies can be classified as
research misconduct. It is assumed that research misconduct is under reported.
Regardless, this misconduct taints the public image of research, wastes donated
or tax-funded dollars, and harms both the professional reputations of
researchers and institutions.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="chapter-3-the-protection-of-human-subjects">Chapter 3: The Protection of Human Subjects&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Human subjects are used in order to find improvements to the human experience.
This could involve the creation of new medicines, surgeries, or experiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers who use human subjects are subject to Federal regulations. Both the
Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki are guidelines that are to be
followed when testing on human subjects. Additionally, the Federal regulation 45
CFR 46 Subparts A - D, known as the &amp;ldquo;Common Rule&amp;rdquo;, are expected to be followed
as well. Exempt research from the &amp;ldquo;Common Rule&amp;rdquo; include:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Research involving the use of educational tests,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if unidentifiable or
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>publicly availible,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Research and demonstration projects which are conducted by or subject to the
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>approval of department or agency heads; or
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Any institution that performs human research must have a Federally mandated
Internal Review Board (IRB) consisting of at least 5 people, one of which is a
scientist, one of which is a non-scientist, and one who is not affiliated with
the institution. Furthermore, all researchers working with human subjects must
undergo National Institutes of Health (NIH) training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All human subjects must have to informed consent and the right to withdraw.
Furthermore, there is an ethical concern in human subjects research that some
experiments have risks without any benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-4-the-welfare-of-laboratory-animals">Chapter 4: The Welfare of Laboratory Animals&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Research on animal subjects is done to benefit humans without experimenting on
humans. The 1966 Animal Welfare Act and the 1985 Health and Research Extension
Act both act as Federal regulations that researcher&amp;rsquo;s experimenting on human
subjects must abide by. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is
responsible for the transportation, care, and use of animals. The usage of
animals for biomedical and behavioral research is subject to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), NIH.
Furthermore, activists have put together guidelines through the Animal Care
Panel (ACP) commonly reffered to as th Guide. The &lt;em>Guide&lt;/em> is widely accepted
both in public and private institutions as well as Federal laboratories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The definition of an animal from the PHS Policy is, &amp;ldquo;any live, vertebrate
animals used or inteded for use in research, research training, experimentation,
or biological testing or for related purposes&amp;rdquo;. the definition of an animal from
the Common Rule that implements the Animal Welfare Act includes warm blooded
animals (mammals) but excludes, &amp;ldquo;Birds, rats of the genus Rattus and mice of the
genus Mus bred for use in research, and horses not used for research purposes
and other farm animals&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Institutions testing on animals must create an Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) which acts similarly to an IRB but for animals. These, along
with the OLAW, USDA, and accrediation programs, are responsible for the proper
care and respect of animal subjects. Prior to using animal subjects, researchers
must defend the usage of animal subjects against the &amp;ldquo;three R&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Replacement - using non-animal models such asmicroorganisms or cell culture
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>techniques, computer simulations, or species lower on the phulogenetic scale,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Reduction - using methods aimed at reducing the numbers of animals such as

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Refinement - the elimination or reduction of unnecessary pain and distress
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>[in animal subjects].
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="chapter-5-conflicts-of-interest">Chapter 5: Conflicts of Interest&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Researchers can experience three different types of conflicts of interest:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>1. Financial gain,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>2. Work commitments, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Intellectual and personal matters.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Financial gains involve reciving money from an institute that the researcher has
a vested in. This could involve having stock in the company, or being a member
of the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work commitments involve colluding multiple working positions into one in order
to serve a singular purpose. In other words, if a position at work is being used
to further a research objective or vice versa, it is a conflict of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellectual and personal matter conflicts of interest occur when the idealogy,
beliefs, or viewpoint of a researcher could interfere with their research
objectives. As an example (not mentioned in this book; purely my own thought
probably taken from someone else) is a pro-life reseacher working on
abortificants.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="part-iii">Part III&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-6-data-management-practices">Chapter 6: Data Management Practices&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Research is not possible without data. Because of this, there are
responsibilities that researchers have to the proper ownership, collection,
storage, and sharing of data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data can be owned by one or many sources. This includes the funders of the
research, the institution where the research was conducted, and the original
source of the data. Typically, government funded research allows the data to be
shared for the public good, privately funded research retain the right to
disseminate the data, and philinthropic funding sources retain or give away
their data ownership rights depending on their motive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data must be collected responsibly. This means that data collection method is
appropriate and reliable. If the method is garbage, the result will be garbage
(garbage in, garbage out). The data collected must be detailed enough to support
the results. It must also be authorized for collection, and when recorded,
proper metadata must be captured to include the date, time, source, and other
important facts about the source of the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After collecting the data, data must be stored properly so as to prevent the
theivery or loss of data. This includes securing lab notebooks and regularly
backing up data files. Additionally, any data that includes personal identifying
information or is otherwise confidential, must go through a process of
anonymizing the data so as to respect the source&amp;rsquo;s privacy. Furthermore, some
data may be subject to a period of retention and if not, data should otherwise
be retained indefinetly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of sharing data with other researchers or the general public, data
must be fully validated, not be preliminary data, and can be confidential until
publication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, future considerations about the data must be taken into account. For
example, the generated data of an experiment can be larger than the amount of
usable computer storage. Furthermore, there is now a concern that released data
can contribute to the terrorism or foreign entities that wish to do harm to the
American public. Ethical concerns about the release of such data must be taken
into consideration prior to releasing said data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-7-mentor-and-trainee-responsibilities">Chapter 7: Mentor and Trainee Responsibilities&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Trainee refers to anyone learning to be a researcher learning from a senior
researcher. To establish the basic understandings of the relationship, trainees
must know from their mentors:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How much time they are expected to put into research,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How performance is judged,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How responsibilities are shared or divided,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Standard operating procedures, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How credit and authorship are assigned.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Whereas mentors expect from their trainees that they:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Do work in a conscientious way,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Respect the authority of others,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Follow research regulations and protocols, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Live by agreements established for authorship and ownership
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>To make sure these expectations are clear, the mentor should lay them out
initally. Furthermore, mentors have are expected to supervise the work of a
trainee. This results in the monitoring, support, and review of a trainees work,
as well as imparting the ethos of being a researcher onto them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The research environment that they mentor creates and the trainee learns in
should be one of:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Equal treatment free from discrimination,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Professional, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Follow the responsible conduct of research
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Postdoctoral researchers have a rough time in the lab as they have the skills to
be an independent researcher, but since they are no longer students nor faculty,
they have little rights. Additionally, since they are working under someone
else&amp;rsquo;s funding, they have little freedom to pursue their own research. The
National Postdoctoral Association has been created to ensure that postdocs have
the rights that they deserve with respect to transitioning to independent
researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="chapter-8-collaborative-research">Chapter 8: Collaborative Research&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Collaborative research involves any time when two or more researchers
collaborate on the same project. This could involve researchers from the same
institution or different insititutions. This work is led by a primary
investigator (PI) who heads the project and is responsible for the compliance of
rules and responsible research conduct, financials, and training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collaborative research projects need to initially solve many problems with
respect to:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The goals of the project and anticipated outcomes,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Everyone&amp;#39;s role,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How data will be collected, stored, and shared,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How changes in the research design will be made,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Who is responsible for drafting publications,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- The criteria to identify and rank authorship,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Who is responsible for submitting reports and meeting other requirements,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Who is responsible for publicly speaking about the work,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How intellectural property rights and ownership issues will be resolved, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- How collaboration can be changed and when it comes ot an end.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>With respect to compliance, it is best practice to work under the compliance
guidelines of the institution or state that has the strictest policies to ensure
that all researchers are following proper protocol.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- What the results are, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- A discussion of the results to better understand their impact.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Authorship serves to let others know who conducted the research and should get
credit for it. It is generally limited to those who were:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>There is disagreement as to whether a researcher needs to adhere to all of these
rules in order to be consider an author. The International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors (ICMJE) have created the &lt;em>Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts

authorship:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>3. Final approval of the version to be published
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The ICMJE guidelines are strict and are not followed by all disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first and last author on a paper carry weight. What this weight means is
dependent upon the field that it is published in.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Research quality can be comprimised if the peer reviewer(s) find:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Careless mistakes made in reporting data and/or listing citations,

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Inaccurate reporting of conflicts of interest, contributors/ authors, and

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Peer reviews judge the importance of the work by answering the following
questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>important to do so?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Are these research results important enough to publish?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Has a researcher made important contributions to a field of study?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Is this evidence important enough to be used in setting policy?
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>By juding importance, a reviewers personal bias is involved. To mitigate this,
reviewers should write transparent reviews in which they lay out their bias as
well as any documents or citations that they found that supports their bias.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Confidentiality is important in protecting peers from attacks from one another.
There exists a double-blind review in which both the reviewers and the authors
are anonymous from one another. It is not appropriate to:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Use an idea or information contained in a grant proposal or unpublished
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>manuscript before it becomes publicly available,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Discuss grant proposals or manuscripts you are reviewing with colleagues in
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>your department or at a professional meeting,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Retain a copy of the reviewed mateial, and
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>- Discuss personnel and hiring decisions with colleagues who are not part of the
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>review process

&lt;p>It is well understood that many people early in their career have irresponsible
research conduct. Additionally, what might be considered responsible conduct in
one field may not apply to all fields. None the less, there is no justification
for comprimising the core tennants of research: honesty, accuracy, efficiency,
and objectivity. Upholding these is the responsibility of all researchers.&lt;/p>
