&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Robust Real-Time Face Detection&lt;/em> by P. Viola and M.J. Jones [1]
presents a new methodology for effieciently performing face detection. They due
this through the usage of an integral image which is able to reduce the
computational complexity to constant time (O(1)) of analyzing an image as it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on scale invarience and thus an image pyramid. Additionaly, the
classifier that they build is &amp;ldquo;simple and efficient&amp;rdquo; and allows for the engineer
to specify a large number of features to be analyzed without comprimising on
performance as it relies upon the AdaBoost algorithm to select imporant
features. Furthermore, the authors propose a method for building a cascade of
classifiers which further reduces computation time as each classifier specifies
. Finally, they propose experiments that can be ran on face detection datasets
to conduct supervised learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this paper does propose many new and innovative ideas, the paper
originates from 2003.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="contributions">Contributions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What are the author&amp;rsquo;s main contributions?&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What has been done prior to this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Prior work has been done in creating face detection systems. Prior work has been
done in creating the AdaBoost algorithm that is used to create a cascade of
classifiers. Prior work has been done in identifying methodologies to create
image features.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We should care about this paper as it presents a non-CNN methodology for
reliably identifying faces in images. Additionally, the authors also present a
methodology for doing this task effieciently on low end hardware.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>Applying SVMS to Face Detection&lt;/em> by Edgar Osuna (as part of the
larger &lt;em>Support vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays in the July/ August edition
of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] describes the usage of
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify faces in static images and real time
systems. The work goes into detail about previous systems that attempted this
task, as well as a real time system that can classify images at 4 to 5 frames
per second.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What type of paper is this work?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper is both a small systems essay, as well as a CV task analysis of the
state of the art when using this particular technique.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What other &lt;em>types&lt;/em> of papers is the work related to?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What has been done prior to this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Quote from the &lt;em>Previous systems&lt;/em> section of the paper:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Researchers have approached the face-detection problem with different
techniques in the last few years, including neural networks [2] [3],
detection of face features and use of geometrical constraints [4], density
estimation of the training data [5], labeled graphs [6], and clustering and
distribution-based modeling [7] [8].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We should care about this essay as it proposes an SVM based solution for both
static image and real time face detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="figures-diagrams-illustrations-and-graphs">Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
conclusions are statistically significant?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The figures are clear and explained well through their captions. However, Table
2 uses a metric called &amp;ldquo;False Alarms&amp;rdquo; to measure the number of times the system
reported a &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo; that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a face. A more appropriate metric, such as recall,
would have been appropriate in this case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="clarity">Clarity&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is the paper well written?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper is well written, however, it can be improved upon. The biggest
complaint that I have is the usage of bullet points to describe tasks/ steps
that were taken to complete a task. Additionally, many bullet points contained
more than one sentence. I find it to be more appropriate for papers to utilize
bullet points for short, unordered lists. Most appropriately used when listing
off different techniques or definitions, which this essay does utilize. Aside
from that, the individual steps are written well and clearly, and seem to be
fairly reproducable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="relevant-work">Relevant Work&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mark relevant work for review&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;h3 id="author-assumptions">Author Assumptions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The authors trained their system to identify vertically oriented, gray-scale
images of faces for their static image face detector. They make no mention as to
whether this detector is capable of identifying faces in off axis positions, or
if their system is capable enough to orient faces properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="correctness">Correctness&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do the assumptions seem valid?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Without understanding the availiblity of datasets at the time, this seems like a
valid assumption to make. However, simple data augmentation (such as rotating
the image) could&amp;rsquo;ve been done to increase the number of training examples of
faces not in the vertical orientation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My own proposed future directions for the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A reimplementation of their work, both on static images and real time image
capture, would be interesting to perform on devices such as cameras, Raspberry
Pis, or other low powered systems. Additionally, comparing the power draw
between an SVM based solution and one that is powered by DL would be interesting
as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>Applying SVMS to Face Detection&lt;/em> by Edgar Osuna (as part of the
larger &lt;em>Support vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays in the July/ August edition
of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] describes the usage of
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify faces in static images and real time
systems. The author goes into detail about existing systems that were powered by
non-SVM techniques, as well as presenting their own system (for both static
image and real time image capture) for face detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their satic image system only works on gray scale images of vertically aligned
faces. Additionally, they used a small dataset to train the SVM. In doing so,
they limit the usage of the static image system to that specific domain, as well
as potentially creating a system that is unable to detect a face in all
potential cases (such as different ethnicities, lighting conditions, face
orientations, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their real time image capture system works on full color images of vertically
aligned faces by using a combination of a skin detector and a &amp;ldquo;primitive&amp;rdquo; motion
detector. This system was capable of recognizing faces at 4 to 5 frames per
second.&lt;/p>
