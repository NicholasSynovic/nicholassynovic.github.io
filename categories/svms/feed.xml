&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>How to implement SVMs&lt;/em> by John Platt (as part of the larger &lt;em>Support
vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays in the July/ August edition of the 1998
IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] discusses how to implement a Support
Vector Machine (SVM). This essay goes into great detail on implementation
strategies for handling larger datasets, as well as methods for training SVMs.
Topics include understanding the Quadratic Problem (what SVMs aim to solve),
sequential minimal optimization (reaching a global minimal value), and where to
find SVM implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="category">Category&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This essay seems to be a tutorial/ workshop paper about SVMs.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What other &lt;em>types&lt;/em> of papers is the work related to?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I would expect papers that are about implementing SVMs from scratch would be
related to this essay.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We should care about this paper as it provides an understanding of what a SVM is

&lt;h3 id="clarity">Clarity&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is the paper well written?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For the most part, yes. However, the essay expects the reader to be knowledgable
about SVMs prior to reading the essay. This is shown mostly through the usage of
mathematical notation specific to the problem domain, and linking to other work
to explain it. While this is a short essay for a magazine, a brief sentence or
two about the notation would have been appreciated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The author assumes that the reader, should they implement their own SVM
algorithm, will be using a commericial numerical analysis package.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="correctness">Correctness&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do the assumptions seem valid?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Without understanding the nature of the numerical analysis packages of 1998, I
would assume that this assumption is correct. I base this on that the author
mentions that free numerical analysis packages (not if they were open sourced or
not) run slower than commercial packages and may have errors due to precision
mistakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My own proposed future directions for the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in creating my own SVM algorithm. However, having a better
understanding of how SVMs work as well as the different minimization functions
that they implement, would be nice to know.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A summary of the paper&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>How to implement SVMs&lt;/em> by John Platt (as part of the larger &lt;em>Support
vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays in the July/ August edition of the 1998
IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] discusses how to implement a Support
Vector Machine (SVM). The author goes into detail about what an SVM is trying to
accomplish (minimize a quadratic problem on a high dimensional matrix), what
techniques exist to solve this problem, as well as availible programs to allow
for researchers to utilize SVMs in their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the essay does a good job of explaining the problem space as well as
implementation details, however, the essay is very much a product of its time.
There is less of a need to develop new SVM algorithms as there are many that are
provided off of the shelf in free and open source numerical analysis packages
[3] [4]. Additionally, the suggestion that readers should purchase a
numerical analysis package to create thier own SVM is dated in my opinion, as
again, there are many free options availible [5].&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>Applying SVMS to Face Detection&lt;/em> by Edgar Osuna (as part of the
larger &lt;em>Support vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays in the July/ August edition
of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] describes the usage of
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify faces in static images and real time
systems. The work goes into detail about previous systems that attempted this
task, as well as a real time system that can classify images at 4 to 5 frames
per second.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="category">Category&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What type of paper is this work?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This paper is both a small systems essay, as well as a CV task analysis of the
state of the art when using this particular technique.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="context">Context&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What other &lt;em>types&lt;/em> of papers is the work related to?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This essay is most similar to papers that discuss systems that implement face

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What are the author&amp;rsquo;s main contributions?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The author&amp;rsquo;s main contributions are a system that utilizes SVMs for real time
facial detection. Additionally, their contributions include a discuss of
previous systems that attempted this task.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Quote from the &lt;em>Previous systems&lt;/em> section of the paper:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Researchers have approached the face-detection problem with different
techniques in the last few years, including neural networks [2] [3],
detection of face features and use of geometrical constraints [4], density
estimation of the training data [5], labeled graphs [6], and clustering and
distribution-based modeling [7] [8].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We should care about this essay as it proposes an SVM based solution for both
static image and real time face detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="figures-diagrams-illustrations-and-graphs">Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
conclusions are statistically significant?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The figures are clear and explained well through their captions. However, Table
2 uses a metric called &amp;ldquo;False Alarms&amp;rdquo; to measure the number of times the system
reported a &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo; that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a face. A more appropriate metric, such as recall,
would have been appropriate in this case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="clarity">Clarity&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is the paper well written?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper is well written, however, it can be improved upon. The biggest
complaint that I have is the usage of bullet points to describe tasks/ steps
that were taken to complete a task. Additionally, many bullet points contained
more than one sentence. I find it to be more appropriate for papers to utilize
bullet points for short, unordered lists. Most appropriately used when listing
off different techniques or definitions, which this essay does utilize. Aside
from that, the individual steps are written well and clearly, and seem to be
fairly reproducable.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The authors trained their system to identify vertically oriented, gray-scale
images of faces for their static image face detector. They make no mention as to
whether this detector is capable of identifying faces in off axis positions, or
if their system is capable enough to orient faces properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="correctness">Correctness&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do the assumptions seem valid?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Without understanding the availiblity of datasets at the time, this seems like a
valid assumption to make. However, simple data augmentation (such as rotating
the image) could&amp;rsquo;ve been done to increase the number of training examples of
faces not in the vertical orientation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My own proposed future directions for the work&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A reimplementation of their work, both on static images and real time image
capture, would be interesting to perform on devices such as cameras, Raspberry
Pis, or other low powered systems. Additionally, comparing the power draw
between an SVM based solution and one that is powered by DL would be interesting
as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>Applying SVMS to Face Detection&lt;/em> by Edgar Osuna (as part of the
larger &lt;em>Support vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays in the July/ August edition
of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1] describes the usage of
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify faces in static images and real time
systems. The author goes into detail about existing systems that were powered by
non-SVM techniques, as well as presenting their own system (for both static
image and real time image capture) for face detection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their satic image system only works on gray scale images of vertically aligned
faces. Additionally, they used a small dataset to train the SVM. In doing so,
they limit the usage of the static image system to that specific domain, as well
as potentially creating a system that is unable to detect a face in all
potential cases (such as different ethnicities, lighting conditions, face
orientations, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their real time image capture system works on full color images of vertically
aligned faces by using a combination of a skin detector and a &amp;ldquo;primitive&amp;rdquo; motion
detector. This system was capable of recognizing faces at 4 to 5 frames per
second.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>SVMs - a practical consequence of learning theory&lt;/em> by Bernhard
Scholkopf (as part of the larger &lt;em>Support vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays

discusses the underlying theory that powers Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithms and argues that these algortihms are useful and performant. His essay
contains sections on &lt;em>Learning pattern recognition from examples&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>Hyperplanes&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Feature spaces and kernels&lt;/em>, &lt;em>SVMs&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Current developments

&lt;p>Is the paper well written?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sort of? The theory components of the essay are written distinctly differently
than the introduction and concluding sections of the paper. This could be due to
the discussion of mathematical prose; but due to this, the essay has two
different voices.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The essay &lt;em>SVMs: A Practical Consequence of Learning Theory&lt;/em> by Bernhard
Scholkopf (as part of the larger &lt;em>Support vector machine&lt;/em> collection of essays
in the July/ August edition of the 1998 IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine) [1]
discuss both the mathematical theory and current practice of using SVMs. SVMs
are useful in a research aspect as their functionality can be mathematically
explained. SVMs are a linear classifier that operate in multi-dimensional space
through the usage of a hyper plane. Hyper planes are choosen by finding support
vectors, which are instances of a class that are closest to one another. The
hyper plane then splits these two instances into two seperable sides. To assist
in this calculation, a kernel algorthm is applied to map one dimensionality
space to another for easier computation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this paper provides a good understanding of the theory behind SVMs. It
also alludes to additional usages of SVMs and their current problems, but it is
not focused on discussing or resolving them.&lt;/p>
