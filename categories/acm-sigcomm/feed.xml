&lt;p>Discussion about the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section
headings, and conclusion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper, &lt;em>How to Read a Paper&lt;/em> by S. Keshav is a tutorial for graduate
students on how to read an academic paper. They propose a &amp;ldquo;three-pass&amp;rdquo; approach
that aims to reduce the frustration that graduate students face when reading
papers. Additionally, they discuss how to perform a literature survey of a new
field, their experience with this methodology, and write that this document is
meant to exist as a living work, with adjustments to be made as seen fit by the
author.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="category">Category&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What type of paper is this work?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This paper is definitely a more causal piece of academic work that aims at
easing students into the reading papers. I would classify this paper as &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo;,
educational, or as a formal letter to students. The later classification is due
to the lack of surveys or qualitative/ quantitative data from others that have
applied this or similar methods to reading papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="context">Context&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What other &lt;em>types&lt;/em> of papers is the work related to?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This paper is most closely related to papers that discuss the writing of
academic works and the review process of academic works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="correctness">Correctness&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do the assumptions seem valid?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The assumptions in the abstract and introduction seem reasonable. However,
assuming that only graduate students are the only ones that struggle with
reading academic works is unrepresentative of &lt;em>my particular experience&lt;/em>.
Undergraduate students as well as professionals in industry also struggle with
reading these works as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="contributions">Contributions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What are the author&amp;rsquo;s main contributions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>S. Keshav&amp;rsquo;s contributions is a three-stage process for reading papers and a
framework for performing literature reviews of a new field.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="clarity">Clarity&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is the paper well written?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This paper is well written and is easy to comprehend. I would strongly recommend
this paper to be read by everyone regardless of academic status.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
conclusions are statistically significant?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are no illustrations to discuss in this paper.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="author-assumptions">Author Assumptions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m nit-picking here, but the S. Keshav focuses solely on graduate students as
the demographic that has trouble reading academic papers. Now while graduate
students do typically read more papers than undergraduates, it is not unheard of
for academic readings to be given to undergraduate students as homework
assignments or for them to read them on their own. Additionally, professionals
in industry also struggle with this task as well. A more inclusive audience
would have been appreciated, but would not have improved the content or quality
of this paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="discussion-of-the-proofs">Discussion of the Proofs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The only proof of the &amp;ldquo;three-pass&amp;rdquo; method that was discussed was the experience
of the author. An awfully biased proof, however, I do appreciate at least some
quantifiable data for this method.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-would-i-present-the-ideas">How Would I Present the Idea(s)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I think the author presented these ideas exceptionally well and clearly, and
cannot think of any additional presentation method aside from the critiques of
the assumptions mentioned in &lt;a href="#author-assumptions">Author Assumptions&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My own proposed future directions for the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A survey of graduate students on their methodology for reading papers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A survey of industry professionals on their methodology for reading papers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An artifact that allows for a user to step through a set series of steps to
properly understand a document.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A summary of the paper&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>How to Read a Paper&lt;/em> by S. Keshav is a &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; or educational paper
about how to read an academic work. Their main contributions are a three step
process on how to read a paper, as well as a framework for performing a
literature review in a new field. This three step process involves a:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Bird&amp;rsquo;s Eye View of the paper where only the Title, Abstract, Introduction,
Conclusion, and section and sub-section headings are read first,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A deeper analysis of figures and content of the paper which involves finding
new, unread references to the reader and evaluating the quality of
illustrations to determine the quality of the paper,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A virtual reimplementation of the paper where every claim of the paper is
analyzed and critiqued; typically this done by reviewers or those that are
doing a deeper analysis of the work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I can see this process being useful for researchers as implementers of other&amp;rsquo;s
research must accomplish all three steps to properly appreciate and understand
what they need to do to perform their task. As for the literature review
framework, it involves utilizing academic search engines (e.g.
&lt;a href="https://https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar&lt;/a>) to find work within a
particular field, finding shared citations or authors within that field, then
evaluating top conferences within that field to see who the top researchers and
research topics are within that field. For exploratory research, this is both an
extremely simple and effective framework to follow and adapt to different
domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, S. Keshav does limit the reach of this paper by making it focus solely
on the woes of graduate students. This is inaccurate of the wider academic
readership, as more and more frequently undergraduate and industry professionals
are reading academic papers both for pleasure and for utilization in
assignments. This paper can easily become more inclusive of wider audiences
without changing the content in an updated version of this document. This would
make sense as the author has requested that this paper be treated as a living
document that can be subject to change as the author adapts his process and
framework for academic review.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would personally like to see this work be quantified in surveys and
implemented as artifacts that ensure that readers are properly following the
review method that the author has laid out.&lt;/p>
