&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Video game consoles have many of the features desired for enterprise deployment.
They are also designed with security in mind, and are resilient against many
vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Video game consoles are cheap, security oriented, and reduce the total cost of
ownership (TCO) that a device has on an employee or organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article aims to compare different video game consoles for enterprise
deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="performance">Performance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Video game consoles, on release, are often more powerful than similarly priced
notebook PCs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="user-experience">User Experience&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The consoles UI is defined to be easy to use. It is also easy to install and
perform simple service on some video game consoles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These devices are also versatile as any application can be written for the
console, however, development is dependent upon the video game consoles SDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="security">Security&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Video game consoles employ identity and access management through Sony,
Microsoft, and Nintendo logins for the PS4/5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch
respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Video game consoles check and install security patches upon boot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Video game consoles are designed with both hardware and software security in
mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cost">Cost&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Similarly designed notebook PCs cost nearly or more than twice as much as many
video game consoles upon their release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Video game consoles embody many of the criteria that is expected of an
enterprise grade notebook PCs.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should you sign your commits?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="preface">Preface&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recently read this article [0] by Alessandro Segala about why I should sign
my commits. And I completely agree with, and would like to expand upon, their
work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="identify-theft">Identify Theft&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Identify theft is not a joke [1].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The FTC in their 2021 edition of the CSN Annual Data Book [2] reported that
there were 1,434,676 reports of identity fraud in 2021 This theft allows the
perpetrator to commit acts of fraud in your name while reaping the benefits. As
developers, we not only have to protect our real world identities from theft,
but our digital ones as well. And while it is important to have strong and
secure passwords, I&amp;rsquo;m not referring to your accounts as digital identities. I&amp;rsquo;m
instead talking about your contributions to open source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article focuses around &lt;code>git&lt;/code> [3] and online version control systems
(VCSs) that implement &lt;code>git&lt;/code> as their back end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not only possible, but incredibly easy to sign a commit under a different
identity. In addition, online VCSs will read the &lt;code>git&lt;/code> commit history and per
commit, add the appropriate account information to the commit (assuming an
account exists with the email address that is attached to the &lt;code>git&lt;/code> repository).
This feature, is meant to provide a user friendly way of viewing &lt;code>git&lt;/code> commits.
However, it also allows for an attacker to take advantage of these tools and
publish commits to a project under someone else&amp;rsquo;s identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-dangers-of-developer-identity-theft">The Dangers of Developer Identity Theft&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The biggest threat to a developer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t sign their commits is the lack of
trust a community can have for a particular developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A malicious attacker who signs off on infected, poorly written, or malformed
commits and publishes to a project can ruin a developer&amp;rsquo;s relationship to a
community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A malicious attacker could publish commits that actively ruin existing features.
They could also introduce bugs into a repository under someone&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-signing">Benefits of Signing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To combat this, &lt;code>git&lt;/code> allows for individuals to sign their commits with a GPG
[4] key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allows for a number of benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Commits in the &lt;code>git&lt;/code> history that are signed have metadata attached to them
saying that they&amp;rsquo;re signed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the GPG key is published to an online VCS that supports this feature, a
&lt;em>verified&lt;/em> tag will be applied to commits that are signed and match a user&amp;rsquo;s
GPG key.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developer identity can be confirmed by running checks against the public
facing key of a commit and a developer&amp;rsquo;s private key.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since reading [0], I have implemented commit signing for my project going
forward. I also now require all group projects to have signed commits prior to
acceptance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setting up signed commits was trivial, and there were plenty of guides [0]
[5] [6] on how to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I strongly encourage all developers to sign their commits in order to improve
the verification of work done by legitimate developers, instead of allowing the
work of thieves to perforate throughout our community.&lt;/p>
