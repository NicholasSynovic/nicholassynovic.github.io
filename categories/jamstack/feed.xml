&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My story with setting up a Gopher and Gemini compatible website powered by
Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A little while ago, I wanted to create my own website. I struggle with creating
frontends for websites, so I choose to use the Hugo [0] static site generator
as it has many great themes. Learning Hugo was simple enough since the most
basic sites are just &lt;code>md&lt;/code> content files and &lt;code>toml&lt;/code> config files. So, after a
brief learning period, I built my website, got it hosted on GitHub Pages [1],
and setup a domain from Google Domains [2] to link to it all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That should be it, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well then I saw these two videos from DistroTube [3] [4] and got interested
in creating and hosting my own Gopher [5] phlog and Gemini [6] capsule. This
is where the annoyances began.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gopher-the-bane-of-my-existence-for-about-a-week">Gopher: The Bane of my Existence (for about a week)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wanted to create a Gopher phlog because I thought it was just plain cool. Who
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a text only mirror of their site not indexed by modern search
engines (probably everyone)? I was aware the Hugo could output my website in a
variety of different formats. But, I had no idea how to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, Jason F. McBrayer had already figured this out in a blog post on his
website [7]. So I copied and pasted away. I ran the Hugo site generator and I
got output! Huzzah! But when I tested the site with the &lt;code>gophernicus&lt;/code> [8]
server, the site was malformed. Links to blog pages lead to nowhere or returned
error message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I deleted my edits, re-copied, re-pasted (?), and ran the generator. Still,
no dice. Even manually typing in his work into my project didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point it was getting late, so I put the project into the back of my head
and would continue to work on it for the next week. My stuborness was because I
knew it was possible to do this conversion, after all, I had gotten output. But
there was a syntax error somewhere that I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, I found documentation for the &lt;code>gophermap&lt;/code> syntax [9] and it all
clicked. I use &lt;code>neovim&lt;/code> [10] as my editor of choice. I use spaces instead of
tabs. &lt;code>gophermaps&lt;/code>, as a product of the 90s, require tabs for link formatting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Insert face palm here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fix for this problem was to &lt;code>:set noexpandtab&lt;/code> and then paste in McBrayer&amp;rsquo;s
work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, the links worked. I then spent some time setting the Gopher template
that he provided to what I wanted, but that was minor work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In all, it took me a week to RTFM and move on from this arguably ridiculous
project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gemini-a-lot-easier-than-gopher">Gemini: A lot easier than Gopher&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was significantly easier to create the Gemini capsule than a Gopher Phlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But before that, I had to create the templates and output settings for Gemini in
Hugo. This, again, was taken care of by Sylvain Durand [11]. With my
&lt;code>:set noexpandtab&lt;/code> option, I copied and pasted his work into my project&amp;hellip; And
boom! It worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was anticlimatic wasn&amp;rsquo;t it? Again, some formatting of the provided template
was necessary, but that was minor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new problem, was how to distribute this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pubnix-whats-old-is-new-again">PubNix: What&amp;rsquo;s Old is New Again&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my research of both the Gopher and Gemini protocols, I found out about
PubNixs: community ran servers that run on low powered machines. These servers
are a modern implementation of the time sharing servers of yore where there were
a few large mainframes in the country that only a few people could log into at a
time. A subset of these PubNixs is the &lt;code>tildeverse&lt;/code> [12]. These are &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong>
community oriented servers that offer free webhosting of the Gemini, Gopher,
HTTP, and Spartan sites. All that&amp;rsquo;s required is to create an account and start
uploading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those that are interested in hosting a Gemini and/or Gopher site, I
encourage the usage of these servers as it takes the problems of hosting content
(maintainence, privacy, port forwarding, etc.) off of your shoulders&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-end">The End?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you ware interested in doing something similar, here is a link to my websites
source code on GitHub [13]. There you can see my templates, scripts, and
config options for generating Gemini, Gopher and HTTP sites. Best of luck, and
happy hacking!&lt;/p>
