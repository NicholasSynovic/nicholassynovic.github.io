&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A summary of the paper&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The review paper &lt;em>Deep Learning&lt;/em> by Yann LeCun et al [1]. discusses the
advances and advantages of deep learning (DL) techniques made up to 2015. The
authors discuss what is DL, how and where it is applied, commercial and academic
usages of DL, the advantages of merging two different architectures together to
solve challenging tasks, and the usage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for
handling natural language processing and speech recognition tasks. As their
paper is purely a listing of work that others have done prior to them, their
contributions were mostly the synthesis of such information into a digestible
document. With that said, each section of their work can be summarized, which is
what I have done here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DL allows for machine learning to surpass its previous limitations of having to
manually represent data in a suitable internal representation (through feature
extraction) by learning the representation itself. Current DL models are
typically trained using labeled datasets in what is known as supervised
learning. A sub-set of the data is used for training, which when ran through the
model, adjusts the hidden weights. These weights are adjusted using a technique
called stochastic gradient descent (SGD). SGD is accomplished by working
backwards through the model and taking the derivative of each weight which is
then used to adjust the hidden weights. Algorithms to do this include &lt;code>tanh(x)&lt;/code>
and &lt;code>ReLU&lt;/code>. &lt;code>ReLU&lt;/code> is the most popular algorithm for this task which is more
commonly known as backpropagation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are useful for analyzing data
structured as a series of multi-dimensional arrays. A typical application of
ConvNets are for analyzing images. RNNs are useful for analyzing data that is
dependent upon prior understanding. Chat bots, speech recognition, and answering
questions about data (i.e where is a character in a book?) are all problems that
are reliant upon the model having some sort of &amp;ldquo;memory&amp;rdquo;. Memory solutions
include &lt;code>long short-term memory&lt;/code> which has been useful for accomplishing these
tasks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Discussion about the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section
headings, and conclusion&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization&lt;/em> by Bolei Zhou
et al. [1] describes using the global average pooling layer of CNNs to not
only regularize data, but also to localize objects in an image &lt;strong>even if the
network wasn&amp;rsquo;t trained for object detection&lt;/strong>. The authors propose a method for
object localization that involves a simple modification to the layer to generate
what they call &amp;ldquo;class activation maps&amp;rdquo; (CAMs), which are heat maps of where the
CNN is &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo; at an image for labeling. The hotter the heat map, the more
focus the CNN is putting on that specific image region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authors go into detail as to how one would accomplish this with a
weakly-supervised object localization method, and its applications towards deep
features for generic localization, fine-grained recognition, and pattern
discovery. They conclude with visualizing class specific units.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their technique accomplishes object localization in a single forward pass on
existing CNN models that utilize a global average pooling layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="category">Category&lt;/h3>

classifiers for object localization.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What has been done prior to this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There has been work done in utilizing weakly-supervised learning to perform
object localization. However, these works either don&amp;rsquo;t evaluate the object
localization task, or utilize multiple passes to perform the task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been numerous work that has gone into visualizing what occurs within a
CNN. Additionally, there has been work that has looked at the global &lt;em>max&lt;/em>
pooling layer, however, this work is the first to utilize the global &lt;em>average&lt;/em>
layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We should care about this paper as it provides a methodology of utilizing
existing CNNs trained on image classification to perform object localization
tasks &amp;ldquo;for free&amp;rdquo;. In other words, this paper presents a methodology for object
localization by reusing existing SOTA CNNs.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I would love to take this work and apply it to my current research in low
powered computer vision. By utilizing larger networks to localize where in a
static scene the object of interest is most likely to be in (for example, a
static video of a bird sitting on a wire), I can pass in this mapping into a CNN
to specifically be interested in that region of the video/ image. Additionally,
by figuring out where a larger CNN is localizing data, I can then mask out any
cold area of the image prior to analysis by a smaller CNN.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A summary of the paper&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization&lt;/em> by Bolei Zhou
et al. [1] discusses a weakly supervised method of performing object
localization on existing CNN models. Their method involves replacing the fully
connected layer at the end of a CNN performing image classification, with a
global average pooling layer into a Softmax layer. This is so that the models
original functionality is not cut from the new model. However, the global
average pooling layer is modified so that a heat map can be extracted focusing
on what the CNN is focusing on prior to labeling the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previous work involved the usage of weakly supervised CNNs, but relied on global
max pooling. Additional work utilized deconvolutional layers to perform a
similar task.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition&lt;/em>
by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zissernman discusses the SOTA performance of their
model in the 2014 ImageNet Challenge on localization and classification tasks.
They discuss that be extending the depth of convolutional neural networks to 16
up to 19 layers, with a 3x3 filter size, SOTA performance is possible without
redeveloping the architecture of existing convolutional neural networks. This is
in contrast to &lt;a href="going-deeper-with-convolutions.md">Szegedy&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a> who proposes
the Inception architecture for classification and object detection; with which
the reference implementation also came first in the 2014 ImageNet Challenge in
its respective tasks. Simoyan et al. discuss the architecture and training that
went into their model (VGG) and how to architect future models to perform as
well or better.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What has been done prior to this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Prior work has gone into optimizing the width and initial convolutions of
convolutional neural networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="going-deeper-with-convolutions.md">Szegedy et al.&lt;/a> proposed a new architecture
(Inception) that achieved SOTA performance in the 2014 ImageNet Challenge. Else,
Krizhevsky et al. [2] and others have proposed improvements to the
convolutional neural network architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should we care about this paper?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We should care about the authors work as increasing the depth of a neural
network by their proposed architecture allows for easy expansion of existing
convolutional neural networks without redesigning the libraries used to create
them.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
conclusions are statistically significant?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The tables that are presented are easy to read, but can be improved upon. Often,
multiple rows will correspond with a single model configuration. This is fine,
however, it is difficult to make out what configuration each row corresponds to.
Additionally, the tables make comparing error percentages easy across model
configurations.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The authors assume that the performance improvements that convolutional neural
networks are achieving are based off of larger data sets and better compute
optimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="correctness">Correctness&lt;/h4>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do the assumptions seem valid?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I agree with their assumption. However, [2] created a SOTA model utilizing a
new architecture, rather than improving upon an existing one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="future-directions">Future Directions&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My own proposed future directions for the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I would love to try and optimize the input layer of convolutional neural
networks by having a computation that not only looks at the color space, but
also the opacity of an image. This would allow for images to have their
background removed for the purposes of classification by making the background
less opaque than the foreground.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A summary of the paper&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paper &lt;em>Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition&lt;/em>
by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zissernman discusses the SOTA performance of their
model in the 2014 ImageNet Challenge on localization and classification tasks.
They discuss that be extending the depth of convolutional neural networks to 16
up to 19 layers, with a 3x3 filter size, SOTA performance is possible without
redeveloping the architecture of existing convolutional neural networks. Their
work builds of previous efforts of improving convolutional neural network
performance by optimizing the filter size and initial layer, but contrasts
contemporaries [2] by not developing a new architecture. Their work has
importance as it shows that the existing convolutional neural network
architecture is capable of SOTA performance by increasing the depth of the
model. They justify this by trying six different model configurations, and
finding that models with 16 to 19 layers performed best on the 2014 ImageNet
Challenge classification and localization challenges.&lt;/p>
