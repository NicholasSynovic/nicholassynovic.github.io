## First Pass

> Read the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section headings, and
> conclusion

### Problem

> What is the problem addressed in the paper?

The author's estimate that there will be ~13 billion cameras by 2030. With so
many cameras capturing data continously, it will become increasingly more
difficult to process all of that data as computational power, network bandwidth,
and storage capactities will limit real-time analysis feasability.

### Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

We should care about this paper because it raises issues and potential solutions
to said issues w.r.t the massive amounts of data generated and the computational
needs of extracting data from said data captured by cameras.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This is a proposal paper. I would also call this a "futurist", or trend-analysis
paper

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This paper is similar to other works that try and predict future computational
needs to solve problems.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

Their main contributions are a number issues and solutions that could potential
solve these issues w.r.t to the 13 billion cameras that are going to be
generating data by 2030.

## Second Pass

> A proper read through of the paper is required to answer this

### Background Work

> What has been done prior to this paper?

Work has gone into predicting future computing trends w.r.t networked cameras'
storage capacities, bandwidth sizes, and hardware capabilities.

### Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs

> Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
> conclusions are statistically significant?

The figures are properly labeled and are clear.

### Clarity

> Is the paper well written?

Yes, this paper is well written.

### Relevant Work

> Mark relevant work for review

The following relevant work can be found in the [Citations](#citations) section
of this article.

### Methodology

> What methodology did the author's use to validate their contributions?

The author's reviewed existing hardware capacities and trends, as well as other
academic and industry trend analysis papers to make predictions about the
future.

### Author Assumptions

> What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?

This whole paper operates on the assumptions that cameras will continue to grow
in capability and popularity at a set rate.

#### Correctness

> Do the assumptions seem valid?

For this type of paper, that seems valid. However, personally I don't like
making predictions about hardware and software trends a decade into the future.

### Future Directions

> My own proposed future directions for the work

### Open Questions

> What open questions do I have about the work?

### Author Feedback

> What feedback would I give to the authors?

Overall, this is a fine work. I would sugest that the author's follow up on this
be evaluating existing s.o.t.a works and seeing if they help address any of the
problems that they raise.
