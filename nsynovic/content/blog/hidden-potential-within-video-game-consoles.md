## Summary

Video game consoles have many of the features desired for enterprise deployment.
They are also designed with security in mind, and are resilient against many
vulnerabilities.

Video game consoles are cheap, security oriented, and reduce the total cost of
ownership (TCO) that a device has on an employee or organization.

This article aims to compare different video game consoles for enterprise
deployment.

### Performance

Video game consoles, on release, are often more powerful than similarly priced
notebook PCs.

### User Experience

The consoles UI is defined to be easy to use. It is also easy to install and
perform simple service on some video game consoles.

These devices are also versatile as any application can be written for the
console, however, development is dependent upon the video game consoles SDK.

### Security

Video game consoles employ identity and access management through Sony,
Microsoft, and Nintendo logins for the PS4/5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch
respectively.

Video game consoles check and install security patches upon boot.

Video game consoles are designed with both hardware and software security in
mind.

### Cost

Similarly designed notebook PCs cost nearly or more than twice as much as many
video game consoles upon their release.

### Conclusion

Video game consoles embody many of the criteria that is expected of an
enterprise grade notebook PCs.
