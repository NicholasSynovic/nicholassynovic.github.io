______________________________________________________________________

## First Pass

> Read the title, abstract, introduction, section and sub-section headings, and
> conclusion

### Problem

> What is the problem addressed in the paper?

This paper addresses the questions surrounding what developers want to see of
their dashboards. As dashboard's are growing in popularity, their usefulness
within the engineering community needs to be addressed and identified.

### Motivation

> Why should we care about this paper?

The authors of this paper conducted a survey with engineers about what they want
to see on their dashboards, as well as introducing a Goal-Question-Metric (GQM)
approach to designing developer dashboards.

### Category

> What type of paper is this work?

This is a survey paper and an problem introduction paper. In other words, this
paper only identifies problem and solutions that developers want, but does not
provide an implementation of these solutions.

### Context

> What other *types* of papers is the work related to?

This paper is related to survey papers and similar problem introduction papers.

### Contributions

> What are the author's main contributions?

The authors main contributions are the results of their survey, an understanding
of how developers want to use their dashboards, and a GQM approach to
identifying why metrics that the survees identified as important are important.

______________________________________________________________________

## Second Pass

> A proper read through of the paper is required to answer this

### Background Work

> What has been done prior to this paper?

Previous work has been done in identifying metrics that engineers think are
important, as well as methods of evaluating the metric's usefulness. Dashboards
have also been created prior to this study and typically follow one of three
different patterns:

1. Stategic
1. Operational
1. Analytical

Finally, work has been done in understanding the usefulness of metrics presented
on dashboards using GQM.

### Figures, Diagrams, Illustrations, and Graphs

> Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that
> conclusions are statistically significant?

The tables are easy and clear to read, however, all of the figures use a font or
graphic that is too small to understand.

Additionaly, the captions of all figures and tables are sparse.

### Clarity

> Is the paper well written?

The paper is well written.

### Relevant Work

> Mark relevant work for review

- Response bias, social desirability and dissimulation [2]
- Common Method Biases in Behavioral Research: A Critical Review of the
  Literature and Recommended Remedies [3]

The following relevant work can be found in the [Citations](#citations) section
of this article.

### Methodology

> What methodology did the author's use to validate their contributions?

The author's interviewed engineers from several different companies to collect
their data. Additionally, prior to the interviews, the questions asked went
through the GQM method to validate their usefulness.

### Author Assumptions

> What assumptions does the author(s) make? Are they justified assumptions?

The author's solely rely upon the GQM method for designing the dashboard. While
a fine method to do so, they do not provide evidence as to why this is the
superior method to do so.

#### Correctness

> Do the assumptions seem valid?

No.

### Future Directions

> My own proposed future directions for the work

I'd like to take their results and bake them into future dashboards that I
design.

### Open Questions

> What open questions do I have about the work?

Why weren't other design philosophies outside of GQM evaluated?

### Author Feedback

> What feedback would I give to the authors?

I'd like to have seen more evaluation of other GQM like methods.

## Summary

> A summary of the paper

*Design and validation of precooked developer dashboards* by Ivanov et al.
describes a survey and study that the authors conducted on engineers working at
different companies about what would make for an effective dashboard. Their
results include utilizing the GQM method for dashboard design, statistics as to
what metrics engineers care most about, and a design philosophy regarding
dashboards for engineers and their direct management.
