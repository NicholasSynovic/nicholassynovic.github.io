## Summary

> "Southern countries" refer to developing nations or countries.

Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain that are executed once
certain conditions are met. These contracts could be used to enforce contract
laws and benefit economies in Southern countries.

### Contract Laws And Their Enforcement In Southern Countries

Formal contracts are legal documents that lay out the rights that parties are
entitled to, the rules they are bound to, and the punishments that they will
experience if they break any rules. Southern countries often do not engage in
formal contracts. Rather informal, repeat agreements are often enough to create
a sense of trust between parties. However, as economies improve, the need for
formal contracts arise as huge investments are often made to support the growth
of these economies.

#### Transaction costs Associated With a Contract in Southern Economies

Both judicial misconduct and judicial error occur around the world. Judicial
misconduct is when a corruption-related action is taken by a judge. Judicial
error is when the courts make an error.

### Smart Contracts And The Role Of Blockchain

Contracts are difficult to enforce outside of small communities in Southern
countries. Smart contracts were envisioned in the 1990s, but prior to the
blockchain were rarely utilized. Pre-blockchain smart contracts relied on cloud
computing, but in Southern countries, that might not be available or reliable.

However, block chain based smart contracts work on a distributed network and can
be enforced as the rules and policies are described within the contract. These
smart contracts can be written above or on the block chain. Above the block
chain means that data is fed into the block chain. Whereas on the block chain
refers to the smart contract existing on the block chain. Regardless, smart
contracts require oracles that provide information outside of the block chain
into the smart contract to enact changes or code.

### Barriers And Challenges

Currently, there are not block chain specific or governing bodies that are
standardizing or regulating smart contracts. It might not be possible to
regulate or standardize smart contracts as well.

Large populations within Southern countries lack internet access, making smart
contracts difficult to enact in the first place. There is also a general lack of
blockchain developers and engineers.
