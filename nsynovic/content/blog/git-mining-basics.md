## Prerequisites

I recommend reading my previous article
[*Version Control Mining Basics*](version-control-mining-basics.md) which
explains what is version control mining, the definitions of base and derived
metrics, and why we care about this with respect to software engineering.

Additionally, we will be computing longitudinal metrics in this series from the
[torvalds/linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/)
repository.

Finally, we will be using `git`, `python3.13`, and `gitpython` to interface with
the software repository. However, we will be developing tooling that should be
easily extensible and modular to support different `git` implementations and
libraries, or even different version control systems entirely.

## The idea

For this post, we are going to extract all of the `git` revision log information
into a SQLite3 relational database. This is to showcase how to extract data from
a `git` repository and showcase how much faster it is to store revision log
infomration outside of `git` for future processing.

## The `VersionControlSystem` interface

To start this project off, we are going to creat a generic
`VersionControlSystem` class that our version control system implementations can
inherit from. This generic will have methods to:

- Get the total number of revisions in a repository,
- Get revision log objects, and
- Parse revision logs,

Since we are using `python` for this work, we can implement this class as
follows:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from collections.abc import Iterator


class VersionControlSystem(ABC):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def count_repository_revisions(self) -> int: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def get_revision_logs(self) -> list | Iterator: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def parse_revision_logs(self) -> list[dict]: ...
```

## Implementing `Git`

Now that we have an interface, we can implement it to support `git`. To do so,
we will be utilizing the `gitpython` library as it provides performant `python`
tooling for working with `git` repositories.

### The `__init__` function

Our `__init__` is fairly simple:

```python
from vcs import VersionControlSystem
from pathlib import Path
from git import Repo, Commit
from collections.abc import Iterator


class Git(VersionControlSystem):
    def __init__(self, repository_path: Path) -> None:
        self.repository_path: Path = repository_path.resolve()
        self.repository: Repo = Repo(path=self.repository_path)
```

We start by importing our `VersionControlSystem` interface we created in the
previous section, as well as the `pathlib.Path` and `git.Repo` objects.
`pathlib.Path` enables us to resolve relative file paths to absolute file paths.
`git.Repo` provides `gitpython` functionality. We then connect to a `git`
repository using a filesystem path, and create the `git.Repo` object.

### Counting the number of revisions

While our `__init__` method was fairly simple, our `count_repository_revisions`
implementation is even simpler.

```python
...


def count_repository_revisions(self) -> int:
    return int(self.repository.git.rev_list("--count", "--all"))
```

This method utilizes a feature of `gitpython` to readily call `git` commands.
Here we leverage `git rev-list --all` which returns a list of all `git`
revisions. Adding the `--count` flag then counts all of the revisions for us. We
then wrap the output of the command in an `int` method to type-cast to an
integer value.

### Extracting revision logs

`gitpython` once again makes our lives easy. One of the libraries methods,
`Repo.iter_commits` provides trivial access to a `git` repository's revision
logs.

```python
...


def get_revision_logs(self) -> Iterator[Commit]:
    return self.repository.iter_commits(rev=self.repository.head.commit)
```

`iter_commits` enables the application to `yield` commit information from a
repository. This enables both concise application writing (in our case), but
also memory effeciancy as we do not have to buffer all of the revision logs
prior to reading them.

### Parsing revision logs

Here is where we need to do some work. Once we get a revision loaded into
memory, we now need to parse the metadata. However, this is also pretty simple
to do thanks to `iter_commits`.

```python
...


def parse_revision_logs(self, revision_logs: list | Iterator[Commit]) -> list[dict]:
    data: list[dict] = []
    revision_log: Commit
    for revision_log in revision_logs:
        data.append(
            {
                "author": revision_log.author,
                "authored_date": revision_log.authored_date,
                "author_tz_offset": revision_log.author_tz_offset,
                "committer": revision_log.committer,
                "committed_date": revision_log.committed_date,
                "committer_tz_offset": revision_log.committer_tz_offset,
                "message": revision_log.message,
                "encoding": revision_log.encoding,
                "parents": revision_log.parents,
                "sha": revision_log.hexsha,
            }
        )

    return data
```

## Results

Here is an example output from the `torvalds/linux` project using the code we
wrote:

```json
{
  'author': <git.Actor "Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>">,
  'author_tz_offset': 25200,
  'authored_date': 1755270154,
  'committed_date': 1755270154,
  'committer': <git.Actor "Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>">,
  'committer_tz_offset': 25200,
  'encoding': 'UTF-8',
  'message': "Merge tag 'io_uring-6.17-20250815' of git://git.kernel.dk/linux\n"
             '\n'
             'Pull io_uring fixes from Jens Axboe:\n'
             '\n'
             ' - Tweak for the fairly recent changes of minimizing io-wq '
             'worker\n'
             "   creations when it's pointless to create them.\n"
             '\n'
             ' - Fix for an issue with ring provided buffers, which could '
             'cause issues\n'
             '   with reuse or corrupt application data.\n'
             '\n'
             "* tag 'io_uring-6.17-20250815' of git://git.kernel.dk/linux:\n"
             '  io_uring/io-wq: add check free worker before create new '
             'worker\n'
             '  io_uring/net: commit partial buffers on retry\n',
  'parents': (<git.Commit "8d084337a32fde0ffa59d5f70d07a54987911ba1">,
              <git.Commit "9d83e1f05c98bab5de350bef89177e2be8b34db0">),
  'sha': '4ad976b0e8ea3247c607cd37abb09440806f898d'}
```

While this output does not stringify `gitpython` captured objects (e.g.,
`git.Commit`, `git.Actor`), it is perfectly usable for future contexts.

## Wrapping up

We've successfully leveraged `gitpython` to mine revision log information from a
`git` repository. Additionally, we created a generic `VersionControlSystem`
class that we will extend later on.

Hopefully this blog post provides a practical introduction to mining version
control systems. The next post will focus on extracting metrics from `git`
repositories as well
