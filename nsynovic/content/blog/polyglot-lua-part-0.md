I've been interested in expanding my toolkit of programming languages for some
time now. I would currently say that I am proficient in Java, C, and C++ and
have expertise in Python. But this clearly isn't the full range of programming
languages or experiences out there. For example, I have very little knowledge of
functional or embedded languages.

To encourage me to write more posts, I'm going to start documenting my
experience learning different programming languages and the projects that I
write with them. To start this series, I will begin with the Lua scripting
language.

## What Is Lua?

Lua is an
["efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language"](https://www.lua.org/about.html)
in active development since 1993. It claims to be fast, but most importantly the
interpreter is very small at only a few 552Kb for the latest (5.4.7) binary.

Personally, this doesn't matter a whole lot to me. Binary size and speed mean
less than if I can glean a new technique or experience from using the language.
But I also don't want to waste time learning a dead language either. So every
language that I learn needs to meet the following criteria:

- Must have a package manager,
- Must be able to test code,
- Must have development tooling (e.g. LSP support, code formatting, linting)
  and,
- (Optional) Must support static typing

Lua supports most of this primarily through community packages.
[`luarocks`](https://luarocks.org/) is the Lua package manager. Lua does not
ship with a unit testing framework by default, but the community seems to have
selected [`luaunit`](https://luarocks.org/modules/bluebird75/luaunit) as the
defacto testing library. LSP and linting support is provided through the
[`lua-language-server`](https://luals.github.io/) and code formatting is handled
through [`stylua`](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua). However, I can't
find tooling similar to Python's [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) to
perform security audits. I believe this to be an open area of Lua library
development.

Lua does not support static typing. But, given the minimal keywords and language
features of Lua, the community has come up with different interpreters and
programming languages that generate Lua code that implement static typing.
[`typedlua`](https://github.com/andremm/typedlua) seemed promising, as it
promised to implement a type system on top of Lua (like TypeScript), but hasn't
received a commit in 5 years. [`ravi`](https://github.com/dibyendumajumdar/ravi)
also seemed promising, but leverages a modified Lua VM which breaks
compatibility with some Lua libraries. I would prefer the TypeScript-like
approach to implementing static types to not break compatibility with existing
libraries.

## Learning Lua

... Will have to wait for the next post. This post took me longer than expected
to compile all of my sources. As a sneak peak, I intend to release a GitHub Lua
template following my
[other templates](https://github.com/NicholasSynovic?tab=repositories&q=template&type=&language=&sort=)
and another repo that is focussed on solving code kata from
[Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code).
